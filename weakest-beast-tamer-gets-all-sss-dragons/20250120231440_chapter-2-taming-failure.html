Had worked double shifts. He wouldn't give these brats the pleasure of seeing him cry.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The contract bond established itself with a flash so weak it barely illuminated his wrist.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His beast now granted him a 10% increase in physical strength.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was all.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a scrawny boy like him, it meant maybe carrying one more small bucket of water, or lasting a few extra minutes in the field. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Other children received the ability to manipulate elements, massive increases in speed or endurance, or even healing abilities.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every creature, from the most common to the rarest, granted power to its summoner. It was a fundamental law of the contract.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jin growled as crimson scales erupted along his arms, his nails hardening into reddish claws. His canines lengthened into sharp fangs, and a golden gleam appeared in his pupils.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Salamander hadn't just granted him control over fire and a 40% increase to his strength, his entire body was adapting. His endurance, speed, and reflexes would increase by 20%, and with each evolution, these numbers would double.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time the salamander reached Silver rank 2, Jin would have triple the strength of a normal human, a 200% increase, 100% in all attributes plus increased resistance and his fire powers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even a simple plant, what Ren had hoped to get, would have provided a 20% increase to vitality as its primary effect, plus a 10% boost to all attributes that could reach 30% or 40% with proper cultivation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the spore...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Pathetic," someone murmured in the crowd. "It's the only known beast that grants no base power. Just that miserable 10% physical strength boost."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren remained in place, bound by protocol to witness the rest of the ceremony. Each new summoning was another reminder of his failure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A wind eagle that enhanced its master's reflexes. An earth bear that doubled physical resistance. A mystic fox that improved perception and senses.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, the final summoner ascended to the altar.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luna Starweaver. Her blue hair cascaded over her shoulders like a waterfall as she placed her black egg on the pedestal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the most expensive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The entire temple held its breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crack that appeared in the egg was like lightning in the night. From within emerged a shadow wolf, its eyes gleaming with ancestral power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The aura that enveloped Luna was almost blinding, multiplied speed, sharpened senses, and the gift of manipulating various types of elemental magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Increases of 500% or 1000% weren't impossible with that creature.</span></p><span class="cjU1ZGJlNDRiY2FlZjRmN2FiMzdkNmY1OWY0ZGZmNGM3"><br>Support the author by searching for the original publication of this novel.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"A beast with Gold potential!" The Ceremony Master's voice trembled with excitement. "Extraordinary! Less than 1% probability even in a high-quality black egg."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren watched as the wolf bowed before Luna, sealing a contract that would elevate her above almost everyone in the city.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Throughout the temple, the changes manifested.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost all children received them happily. It was the moment they'd waited for their entire lives.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The weakness they'd felt in recent years due to mana poisoning transformed into a sensation of ecstasy and power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The eagle boy developed silver markings on his skin and his eyes grew sharper. The girl with the mystic fox saw her senses amplify while reddish marks appeared on her cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each transformation was unique, powerful, a symbol of their new status.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost all, except Ren's... </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His spore would be the symbol that his status was now the lowest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least, he thought with bitter irony, it can't get worse than this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had no idea how wrong he was.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, it was his turn to transform.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The spore simply... dissolved. It melted into his skin without the slightest spectacle, and for a moment, nothing happened.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, small luminescent mushrooms began to sprout from his scalp, like tiny glowing toadstools among his hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The laughter was instantaneous.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Look! He's rotting!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Hey, Patinder! Are those mushrooms on your head or little peni…"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Silence!" The Ceremony Master tried to intervene, but the mockery continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Careful, it's contagious!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Don't get too close or you'll grow mushrooms too!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Ceremony Master cleared his throat after failing to silence the kids, trying to maintain the moment's dignity. "The spore... uh... can mature with proper time. It could reach up to fifty centimeters and grant a 20% increase in physical strength."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">More laughter. Everyone knew that getting a spore to mature was almost impossible.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cost in resources and time would be astronomical, all for a result that any common beast achieved from day one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some children even pretended to sneeze and made faces of fear when passing near him, as if he could infect them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each successful transformation around him only made his situation more pathetic. While others received claws, mystical marks, and changes that screamed power, he had gotten... "unpleasant decorations" for his hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luna was the last to transform.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The contract with her shadow wolf covered her skin with delicate silver marks that seemed to dance with the light. Her eyes acquired a supernatural gleam, and her blue hair rippled as if submerged in water. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The aura of power emanating from her was almost tangible, 100% speed plus 50% increase in all physical capabilities, plus the gift of elemental magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms on Ren's head flickered weakly, as if even they were ashamed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"In one week," announced the Ceremony Master, "you will begin your formal education. The carriages will come to collect you for school as agreed in the contract, where you will remain until maturity, 8 years. Afterward, you will have a brief rest before beginning your military service."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He paused.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Keep your beasts fused. It is a show of respect toward the sacred bond you have formed today."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ceremony ended.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren waited until he was outside the temple. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Away from the mocking glances, the whispers, the poorly disguised pity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only then did he close his eyes and expel the spore from his body. The luminescent mushrooms disappeared from his hair, and the small gray mass returned to floating beside his shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">To hell with respect. To hell with traditions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thirty years of his parents' work, they sold their house, saved over 1 million crystals with a frugal life, all... to ruin it with his bad luck.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The path home had never felt so long.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each step was a reminder of what he had failed to become, of hopes that had vanished with that pathetic gray glow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The spore floated silently beside him, barely visible in the evening light. His new companion. His symbol of failure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His destiny.</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
