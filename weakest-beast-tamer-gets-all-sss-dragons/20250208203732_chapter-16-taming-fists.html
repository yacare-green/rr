"Isn't he adorable?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren wasn't trembling from fear. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was trembling from frustration. He could see their beasts' flaws so clearly: the irregular mana pattern in the eagle's feathers, the instability in the other boy's green scales.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Useless knowledge when you're about to be beaten.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But maybe there was something useful in there after all.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowledge flowed through Ren's mind as the tiger boy maintained his grip: a spirit tiger at Iron rank granted 30% strength and 10% in all other attributes. At Silver 3 those numbers would multiply, 180% strength, 60% in the rest. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gap between beasts widened dramatically with each rank.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now, at Iron, the difference wasn't so overwhelming.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren himself, though thin after his latest growth spurt, had a healthy constitution thanks to good nutrition. He wasn't from a rich family, but his parents always put him first and were cooks. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His 10% increase in physical strength wasn't insignificant when it came to moving his light body with ease.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"What do you know about beasts, Rotting Boy?" the tiger boy raised his fist, his feline features accentuated by rage. "Your fungus isn't even a real beast!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in Ren's hair pulsed. A spirit tiger's attack pattern always started the same way, a direct punch to the face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren could even understand the boy's body positioning before the attack. So he pushed up against the hand holding his shirt.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the other hand cut through the air trying to punch where his head had been an instant before, Ren couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Is that all?" he mocked, his heart pounding hard.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy with green scales, who had been watching silently, narrowed his eyes. "It was just luck Jin. He's just trying to provoke you."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Can't even manage to hit the weakest one with your 'superior' beast? Maybe mushrooms aren't so pathetic after all."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A tense silence fell over the group. It wasn't just Jin who felt insulted now, everyone who had belittled Ren for his spore looked at him with growing fury.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was the rotting boy suggesting their beasts weren't better than the miserable spore?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Shut up!" Jin finally roared, his wounded pride transforming into rage. "I'll show you what a spirit tiger can do!"</span></p><span class="cjAxNmFlMzc5OWJlMDRjODM5MGQyMzFiOTg5MzBmNzg0"><br>Ensure your favorite authors get the support they deserve. Read this novel on the original website.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren moved by pure reflex, recognizing the pattern once again, his lighter body responding with agility that surprised even himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"That's enough!" The boy with green scales, who until then had only watched, activated his quick movement ability and put his foot behind Ren. Ren stumbled, losing his precarious balance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren noticed the attack patterns again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But knowledge only helped if you had time to use it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, there was no time to react. The fist connected with devastating force, Jin's extra 30% translated into a pure impact.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Who's pathetic now?" Jin growled, but his words sounded more like those of a hurt child than a real threat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in Ren's hair pulsed weakly. All that knowledge, and still...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fist rose again. This time Jin was going to use his tiger's real ability. That could seriously hurt Ren.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"You're going to learn to keep your mouth shut, Fungus..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The carriage door burst open, flooding the interior with bright light.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The carriage had stopped and the driver opened the door for them to get out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"What's going on here?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jin's fist stopped centimeters from Ren's face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The driver warned them that fighting would cost them points if the teachers saw, but he didn't do more than that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though it was enough to prevent the worst.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The group descended and the driver left, but before Ren could get away they surrounded him again. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With nowhere to escape, the tiger boy grabbed his shirt and dragged him toward a hidden side of the building.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Now then, Rotting Boy," he smiled, his fangs gleaming. "No one's going to interrupt us while we teach you something about respecting your superiors."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His companions formed a circle, blocking any escape route. The mushrooms in Ren's hair flickered nervously.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He would have to use his knowledge to try to get out of this, maybe a good hit could help him escape, this Jin kid didn't have a defensive beast so a punch would hurt him. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The problem was the lizard boy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Look how his little mushrooms are trembling again," mocked the eagle girl. "Are they as scared as he is?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren wasn't trembling from fear still. He was trembling from excitement... Could he prove he wasn't so far below them?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fist rose again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm going to teach you why you shouldn't stick your rotting nose in…"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Three against one?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice cut through the air like an ice knife. Luna Starweaver emerged from the shadows, her wolf materializing beside her like a nightmare made real. Her blue hair rippled with its own energy, and her blue eyes...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tiger boy dropped Ren as if he was too hot to touch.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We were just teaching the Rotting Boy some manners," he muttered, backing away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Manners?" Luna arched an eyebrow. "Three beasts with Silver potential against the weakest of all. How... pathetic."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"He started it," protested the eagle girl. "He said things about our beasts..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"And that makes you feel threatened?" Luna's voice was soft but sharp. "A Silver-rank beast threatened by the weakest of all? That makes you sound more pathetic than him."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tiger boy straightened, trying to recover some dignity. "It's not fair that you…"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"That I what?" Luna took a step forward. "That I use my advantage against you? Like you were doing a moment ago? Would you feel good if I did?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silence that followed made the hierarchy clear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Get out of here," Luna ordered. "All of you." </span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
