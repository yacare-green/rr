Under his domain, even tiny lizards could breathe flames.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Blue Dragon reigned in the ocean depths with his majestic fins and gleaming horns, where every marine creature swore loyalty.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Green Dragon, covered by a thick layer of vegetation, was lord of the deep forests, where every beast and plant danced to his will.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the eternal skies, the White Dragon commanded all flying creatures, while the Black Dragon governed the beasts of night and shadow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The book showed a particularly detailed illustration of the Articulated Dragon, whose domains were filled with giant insects and creatures with exoskeletons.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each evolutionary line, each egg color, was represented by a dragon. Scholars denied the correlation between dragons and egg colors due to variations diverging from logical branches in egg outcomes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that wasn't relevant knowledge for the child.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren paused at a page that had always intrigued him: the Dragon of Decay, lord of fungi, spores, and all creatures that fed on decomposition.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reigning above, feeding and creating all creatures of his evolutionary line.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"At least dragons respect their subjects," he murmured bitterly, looking at his pathetic spore. "Unlike humans."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the dragons and their territories were far from the human city, and for good reason.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Humans had chosen to settle in this area precisely because the mana was so scarce that great beasts found it repulsive. They had no interest in it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">For humans...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was their only protection.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only the weakest creatures, expelled and rejected by the stronger ones, prowled near the city. In the plains.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was very rare, they had to be injured, dying, to dare leave the forest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without mana, hunger would catch them and they would die soon.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mana here, in human territory, wasn't nearly sufficient.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet they were deadly dangerous, maddened by the hunger that mana scarcity provoked in them. Like wild animals seeking their next meal, they attacked anything that moved.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren shuddered remembering the stories his father told about the forest outskirts. </span></p><span class="cjliZTk2ZDFhNDkwODRhZjliN2Q1YTUzNjgyZDgzNWE5"><br>Stolen content alert: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">How the beasts there had an empty, desperate look. How they ignored their own wounds, driven only by hunger and lack of mana. Even herbivorous creatures turned aggressive, attacking any source of mana they could find.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was just the outskirts.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In dragon territories...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mana would be Ren's worst enemy, with a beast of this level, he could barely enter the first iron circle, with the lowest-ranked beasts. Fortunately, the ruin his father found was right at the beginning of the bronze ring... And he could enter through the middle of the iron ring.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something like that could be possible even for him, right?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure, he wanted to go to dragon territory and find a miracle like obtaining two beasts. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, he would have to settle for medicine that could expel his spore from his body or something similar.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something like that could be close to the medicine that cured his mother.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dragon territory, or even the silver ring, were out of consideration. If he ventured too deep...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mana would consume you quickly and...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren slammed the book shut, his heart pounding.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Would he really go to that forest?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even thinking about it was madness. With his useless spore, mana might not be a problem, as he probably wouldn't survive even his first encounter with a beast.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But while listening to his parents' muffled sobs through the wall...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">What other choice did he have?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As night fell...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Determination had awakened more than courage in Ren... his stomach growled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The aroma of sweet root stew still floated in the air, more tempting than ever as his hunger had returned now that he had a clear purpose.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He slipped out of his room like a shadow, the spore floating silently behind him. The floorboards creaked treacherously under his feet, but years of sneaking out to steal midnight snacks had taught him where to step.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the kitchen, the feast his parents had prepared remained untouched. Ren wrapped large portions of bread with stew in clean cloths, also packing several wild berries.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His father always said berries helped keep the mind clear when fatigue struck.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the tool cabinet, he took his father's smallest kitchen knife, the one used for delicate work, and a worn canteen. Rope and his father's most precious map. He hesitated a moment before also taking the flint for starting fires.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn't much, but it would have to be enough.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A noise in the hallway made his heart stop. Footsteps.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He snuck back to his room and got into his bed just as the door opened.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Ren?" His mother's soft voice. "Darling..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren dove under the covers, grateful for the darkness hiding the packed bag under his bed. The spore settled on his pillow, its weak gray glow perfectly matching the moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm so sorry, my love," whispered his mother, sitting on the edge of the bed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hand, rough from years of work but always gentle, stroked his hair. "If we could have gotten you a better egg..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's not your fault, Mom, or Dad's," replied Ren, and for the first time in hours, he wasn't faking the emotion in his voice. "It... it was just bad luck."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Would you like some stew? It's still warm..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Tomorrow," promised Ren, hating the lie but knowing it was necessary for his mission. "Thank you for cooking it."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She leaned down, kissed his forehead, and the familiar aroma of spices and love almost broke his resolve. Almost.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I love you, little one."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I love you too, Mom."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door closed softly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren waited, counting his heartbeats, until the footsteps retreated and the house fell silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With movements practiced during his afternoon escapes with friends, he tied the rope. His bedroom window overlooked the back garden, a drop of barely two meters. The spore watched silently as he secured the rope to his bedpost.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"If you're going to follow me on this journey," he whispered to his companion while shouldering his backpack, "you'd better at least not get in my way."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The night was clear, illuminated by nearly a dozen moons. From his window, he could see the dark forest beyond the city limits. Somewhere out there lay his only hope for a different future.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He took the rope in his trembling hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry, Dad.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And he began his descent.</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
