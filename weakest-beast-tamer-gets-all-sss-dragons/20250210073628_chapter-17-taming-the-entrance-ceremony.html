"All of you."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"This isn't over, rotting-boy," Jin growled. "We'll see you later."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the bullies fled from Luna, Ren gently touched the mushrooms in his hair. The knowledge they provided was worth every taunt, every threat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though that didn't make things easier.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the others hurried to obey, Luna looked at Ren for a moment. There was no sympathy in her gaze, only a kind of calculating curiosity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or so Ren thought, still...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Thank you," Ren said when the others had left. "For helping me."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luna looked at him as if he were a particularly annoying equation she needed to solve.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I didn't do it for you," her voice was cold, practical. "I did it because I dislike those who abuse their power. Three Silver beasts against the weakest of all..." she shook her head. "It's pathetic."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her shadow wolf watched her with its bright eyes, tilting its head as she continued:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"You'd do well to stay away from trouble. And frankly, you should consider keeping your spore separate from your body. Those mushrooms on your head only make you a more visible target."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I won't," Ren's response was immediate, firm. "My spore isn't weak. And I'm going to prove it."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luna raised an eyebrow, studied him for a moment...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Interesting," she murmured, more to herself than to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She remembered this boy from invocation day, how could she forget the only one with a gray egg among so many bright colors, almost all children of rich and powerful families.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luna hadn't understood why someone who could only buy that type of egg was at this school. The terrible result was even more unexpected.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had been so visibly depressed that day, so defeated...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now there was something different about him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not just the luminescent mushrooms in his hair, but something in his posture, in his eyes. He looked more... bright. And she didn't mean the mushrooms on his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Delusion or courage?" she murmured, more to herself than to him. "Very interesting."</span></p><span class="cmJlNzkxZDY1NWEyMTRjNDFiZjZjNmJjYzAxYzdlZjQ3"><br>Help support creative writers by finding and reading their stories on the original site.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned to leave, but paused for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We'll see if that confidence of yours lasts at least the first year," she said over her shoulder, her wolf vanishing into the shadows along with her. "Though I doubt it."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren watched her disappear before he could ask what was so ‘interesting’, the mushrooms in his hair pulsing softly… But he didn't need her to believe in him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He didn't need anyone to believe.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not yet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial Academy rose before him, its towers casting long shadows over the city.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Imperial Academy's Great Hall was impressive. Marble columns veined with mana lines rose toward a vaulted ceiling where carved beasts seemed to move in the shadows.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The new students gathered in orderly rows, their fused beasts creating a spectacle of colors and transformations.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Except for Ren, of course. The mushrooms in his hair stood out like a 'gray' stain amid so much 'brilliance'.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though he was the one who glowed... literally.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Welcome," the Director's voice resonated through the hall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was a tall, thin man, with a fused Gold beast, a royal phoenix whose golden feathers intertwined with his white hair. "To the most prestigious institution of beast cultivation and evolution."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren watched fascinated. His new knowledge allowed him to see some of the phoenix's mana patterns, the complexity of its evolution, though everything related to Gold-rank beast cultivation remained nebulous in his mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Over the next eight years, you will learn not only to strengthen your beasts, but to understand the very nature of the bond between tamer and creature. Some of you will reach Silver rank. A few, very few, might go beyond."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His gaze paused briefly on Luna, whose shadow wolf had Gold potential. Then, almost imperceptibly, on Ren.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"However," he continued, "rank isn't everything. History is full of tamers who achieved the impossible with seemingly weak beasts. Everything depends on your dedication, your understanding, and above all, your willingness to see beyond the obvious."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The whispers began immediately. Everyone knew it was a diplomatic lie, a way to console those who, like Ren, had bad luck in their invocation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, to Ren the irony of the message sounded different.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The professors will assign your dormitories and schedules. Classes begin tomorrow at first light."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Director paused.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"One last thing: at the Imperial Academy, we value individual progress, but also contribution to society. We don't reward direct abuse based on beast rank, social levels depend on each other, so you'll lose points for misbehavior but gain points for contributing. Everyone has potential... Don't waste it."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, his gaze clearly stopped on the group that had beaten and threatened Ren in the carriage. The tiger boy shifted uncomfortably.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the students began to disperse, Ren noticed something curious.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair pulsed with a different rhythm near certain areas of the hall, as if responding to a powerful stimulus beneath the floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowledge flowed through his mind: perhaps the Academy had indeed been built on ancient ruins. Ruins where...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He might find the runes he needed without buying them if he was lucky.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"All first-year students, this way!" A professor's voice interrupted his thoughts. "It's time to assign dormitories!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren followed the crowd, but his mind was already working. The Academy held more secrets than it appeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And he had eight years to discover them.</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
