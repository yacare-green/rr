Min called him as they headed to the caves. "Liu taught us some tricks yesterday. Want us to show you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Crystals near the surface usually form specific patterns," explained Taro as they descended. "Liu says you have to look for lines that cross at 60-degree angles."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"He also taught us to distinguish between mature and premature crystals," added Min, pointing to a vein in the wall. "See how the color is more intense in the center? That means it's ready for extraction."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren watched, fascinated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knowledge flowing through his mushrooms confirmed what they were saying, but added details: how the crystals' arrangement indicated their purity, how mana lines converged at specific points...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"And most importantly," Taro lowered his voice, "he showed us how to avoid unstable zones. Some tunnels look safe but..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A distant cracking sound emphasized his words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Liu says accidents are common among overeager novices," Min shuddered. "That's why it's better to work in groups, at least at first."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren wasn't too worried about that. With the right knowledge, even these surface veins could be more productive than they appeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Shall we start here?" he suggested, pointing to a spot where mana lines subtly intersected. His companions couldn't see them, but they trusted his judgment after recent events.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As they began working, Ren couldn't help but smile. Between Lin's brutal training and gathering with his companions, maybe this new rhythm of life wouldn't be so bad.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though his muscles immediately protested when lifting the pick, reminding him that the "light" night training was still to come...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A while later, the boys gained confidence to disperse and dig in deeper places...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">At fifty meters below the entrance, Ren examined the tunnel wall attentively. Despite it being his first day mining, his movements were surprisingly precise.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Another one?" Min watched in disbelief as Ren extracted a good-sized crystal. "That's the fifth in half an hour."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Are you sure you hadn't mined before?" Taro set down his pick, frustrated. "We were supposed to have the advantage from the extra time yesterday with Liu."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's just observation," Ren pointed to a pattern in the rock. "See how the lines cross here? Where energy converges like this, there are usually crystals behind."</span></p><span class="cjAzMGNmODdlODllNjQ2ZTZiOTBhNjY1MmZjNWM3Y2Jm"><br>Stolen from its original source, this story is not meant to be on Amazon; report any sightings.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"How do you know all that?" Min narrowed his eyes. "I can't see anything you're talking about... It's cheating to have so much knowledge."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"You know pretty strange things... Like knowing Kai's scale defects," added Taro, though he smiled saying it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Footsteps interrupted them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Klein Goldcrest passed nearby, his golden lion manifesting in brilliant fur covering his arms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As always, he was heading toward where Luna worked.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luna was in the deepest section of the allowed zone, her shadow wolf making the darkest veins glow with a spectral radiance. Unlike most who worked in groups, she mined alone, each movement precise and elegant even in this mundane task.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's almost unfair," Min murmured as they watched her work. "Her wolf can detect mana concentrations we can't even see."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's more than that," Ren observed, the mushrooms in his hair pulsing while analyzing her technique. "Look how she strikes at specific angles. She doesn't waste a single movement."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Luna!" Klein's voice echoed in the tunnel. The Goldcrest family heir approached.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Luna!" his voice resonated in the tunnel again. "I found an exceptional vein over here, if you want we could..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm busy," Luna's sharp response echoed from the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"How pathetic," Jin's voice came from another tunnel above Ren's. "The Goldcrest heir begging for attention again?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Klein turned, furious. "Shut up, I don't want to talk to someone with a mediocre beast like yours."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Why don't you come up here and we'll discuss it, maned kitten?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Enough," Luna's cold voice cut the tension. "Some of us are trying to work."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both retreated, exchanging murderous glances.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"As I was saying," Ren continued once they'd gone, "there are patterns in how mana forms. Crystals are usually found where..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Look out!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A small avalanche of rocks fell near them. Jin smiled from the upper level.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Oops, how clumsy of me," his smile turned cruel. "But the Rotting Boy should know all about things falling to the bottom, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Is there a problem?" Min stepped forward, his water snake materializing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Not for now," Jin shrugged. "Just make sure to look up while you work. You never know when there might be another... accident."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Jin left, Taro picked up his pick with trembling hands. "Maybe we should find another section."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"No," Ren studied the wall. "This vein is too good to abandon. Besides," he smiled slightly, "it would be a shame to give that idiot the satisfaction, don't you think?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Min and Taro exchanged glances before smiling too. Jin could threaten all he wanted, but they needed those crystals.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, the professor wouldn't let them get into too much trouble...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Did I hear cave-ins, is anyone hurt?" Professor Song's voice cut through the air. Jin smiled innocently and walked away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Jin disappeared through the upper tunnel, Ren went back to examining the vein they were working.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"There's something else that worries me," he began while extracting another crystal. "Have you noticed how some tunnels up there had fewer crystals than yesterday?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Now that you mention it," Taro observed the upper walls, "the areas where Liu taught us yesterday are almost empty."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Mana takes time to regenerate veins," explained Ren. "That's why most focus on intensive mining at the start of the year. By the time crystals form again after the holidays, most will move on to focus on other classes soon."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"How long do we have?" asked Min.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"A month, maybe two before it becomes significantly harder to find good crystals." Ren stored another crystal in his bag. "That's why we need to take advantage of every moment now."</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
