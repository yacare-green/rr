"Classes are important, but what you do with your free time..." he smiled, "that's what really determines your success here."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren nodded, understanding. It was a system designed to reward initiative and personal effort.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though the real knowledge was already in his head and surely wouldn't be in any book, at least he could accompany his roommates and learn how others had tried to cultivate creatures like his.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while of studying, the boys went to eat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The iron dining hall occupied much of the first floor. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn't an unpleasant place, clean floors, well-maintained wooden tables, wide windows, but compared to the other dining halls visible from there...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's part of the incentive system," Liu explained when he joined them at the table. "From here you can see the bronze dining hall, and from there you can see the silver one."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren observed his plate: white rice, boiled vegetables, and a small portion of meat. The food was... adequate. The ingredients seemed of good quality, but the preparation was deliberately simple.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"They could make it taste better," Liu pointed with his chopsticks toward the other dining sections. "But then, what motivation would you have to rise in rank?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"At least it's nutritious," Ren sighed while eating. As a cook's son, he could notice the lack of spices and the slightly overcooked point.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Hey, it's better than having to make and pay for it ourselves... Though I do miss the taste of salt."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Little pupil!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cheerful voice made several heads turn. Professor Lin advanced between tables, attracting looks wherever she passed. It wasn't common to see teachers in the iron dining hall, especially one so attractive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Oh..." Liu dropped his chopsticks. "This is interesting."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"What is?" asked Ren as Lin approached.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Master Lin never comes here," Liu lowered his voice. "She's... well, she's something of a legend in the academy."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"A legend?" Min leaned in, interested.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Her beast got stuck at Bronze 1, a shame, but her combat technique is incredible. They say she can defeat even masters with Silver beasts in controlled duels. That's why she keeps her position here despite..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Despite what?" asked Taro.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Politics in the academy are complicated," Liu observed as Lin approached. "Normally, a master with a beast of such low rank would be..."</span></p><span class="cjdiOGQ4NmQ1Mzg3NzRmYTI5OTBmZTA2MGZhZTE1ZTQ2"><br>The author's narrative has been misappropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lin stopped at their table, Liu stopped talking.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Oh no," she murmured seeing Ren's half-empty plate. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"No, no, no. You need to eat more than that." She sat beside them, ignoring the surprised whispers. "How do you expect to develop muscles with that miserable portion of meat? No, no, no. You need at least triple."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Professor..." Ren blushed when she started filling his plate with more food.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Students at nearby tables watched the scene in amazement. Some had even stopped mid-bite.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The food here is..." Ren began.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Simple? Bland? Graceless?" Lin smiled. "Of course it is. But," she pinched his cheek while serving him more, "you need the energy for my training."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nearby students watched open-mouthed. Professor Lin, sitting with the Gray Wing students? Personally serving food to the mushroom boy?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Um..." Taro looked nervously around. "Shouldn't we go to the mine after this? To get crystals for cultivation..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Oh, he'll have time for that," Lin smiled while watching Ren eat every bite. "After I'm done with him."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Professor," Liu bowed respectfully, "it's an honor..." he blushed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Master Lin gives the best combat advice in the academy," Liu explained, glancing at the others. "Though normally she only helps older students who've proven their worth."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Oh, but this little one proved something today," Lin ruffled Ren's hair, making the mushrooms glow. "You don't see someone use pure knowledge to defeat a technically superior opponent every day."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The whispers intensified.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Though first," she pushed another plate toward Ren, "we need to work on your physical endurance. I can't have a student who faints after one fight."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in Ren's hair pulsed nervously as she kept filling his plate. For some reason, her playful smile scared him more than all of Kai's blows.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Professor," Min asked, fascinated by the whole situation, "is it true you once defeated a Silver beast master?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Oh, that old story..." Lin sighed theatrically. "Just luck. And the poor man was distracted by... well, that doesn't matter. What matters," her smile turned predatory as she looked at Ren, "is that our little expert needs to learn that knowledge without technique is like a knife without an edge."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"But first," she pushed a third plate toward Ren, "eat. Everything. You're going to need the energy for what's coming."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lin's smile promised a training hell, but for some reason, Ren couldn't help smiling too. For the first time since arriving at the academy, he felt he'd found someone who truly saw his potential.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Is this the training field?" Ren observed the secluded area behind the Gray Wing while holding his enormous belly. It was a simple but functional space, with packed earth ground and some basic equipment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The main fields are more impressive," Lin smiled while stretching. "But here we'll have privacy. First things first, we need to build a solid foundation."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Aren't we going to practice combat techniques?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"With those noodle arms?" Lin shook her head. "Your spore gives you 10% more strength, right? But 10% of almost nothing is still almost nothing."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She approached a pile of logs. "Most students depend too much on their beasts. A spirit tiger can give 30% more strength, but if the base body is weak..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Like me," Ren lowered his gaze.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Like you now," Lin corrected. "But that's going to change. You're going to train until that 10% really means something better than another 30%... Vomiting is forbidden."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next minutes were a succession of basic exercises: push-ups, squats, running. Nothing spectacular, nothing magical. Just the fundamental work needed to build a stronger body and prevent food from escaping his stomach.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Technique will come later," Lin explained while correcting his posture. "First you need the strength to execute it properly."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time they finished, Ren could barely stand. The mushrooms in his hair glowed faintly, as if they too were exhausted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Same place, tomorrow after classes," Lin threw him a towel. "And Ren..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Yes?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"This is just the beginning."</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
