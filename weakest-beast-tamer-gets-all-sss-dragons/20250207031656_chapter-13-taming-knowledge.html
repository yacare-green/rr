He stood from the table, fresh tears in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Please, don't say that. Don't apologize. I... I was foolish." His voice trembled but was full of conviction. "That egg. This fungus... your gift... is the best gift in the world. I was stupid not to see it before."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He bowed deeply to his parents, tears falling to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Forgive me for not thanking you properly. For all your sacrifices, for everything you've done for me. I... I will triumph at school and make you proud. I promise."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair glowed softly, as if nodding to his words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We already are," his mother whispered, lifting him up and embracing him. "We always have been."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His father joined the embrace, and for a moment, under the light of the nine moons filtering through the window, the small family remained united, stronger than ever.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren smiled through his tears. He had much to tell them, much to explain. But for now, this was enough.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was home.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the bathtub, while hot water washed away the mud and spores from his skin, Ren reflected on his new knowledge.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair glowed softly, reflecting in the water like tiny stars.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His parents' plants... Now he could clearly see what had happened. The knowledge flowed in his mind like a perfectly detailed manual:</span></p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Basic Plant Development: </span></em></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Iron Rank: Provide 100 correct development points to rise in rank </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">If 1000 points accumulate without specific direction: premature maturation </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Result: Weak Seedling Intermediate Maturation (only path available in Iron rank)</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His parents hadn't had a choice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without knowledge of evolution routes, without resources to buy proper cultivation techniques in their youth, their plants had accumulated development points randomly until reaching the limit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once they reached 1000 points, maturation was inevitable.</span></p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Unrealized Potential Paths: </span></em></p><p><strong>Bronze Rank. </strong></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bronze 1: Common Seedling </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Bronze 2: Strong Seedling</span></li></ul><p><strong>Silver Rank. </strong></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Silver 1: Weak Plant </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Silver 2: Common Plant </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Silver 3: Strong Plant</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The water cooled while Ren reviewed this information.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was fascinating and tragic at once. His parents had worked so hard, but without the correct knowledge, without understanding the evolution paths...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren straightened in the bathtub.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were no paths left, but...</span></p><span class="cjRiZTVkMjlkZDBiNjQyZDY4MGY3NjI1MGYwYTMzOWU2"><br>If you encounter this tale on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was an option.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knowledge unfolded in his mind, clear and precise:</span></p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Thousand Days Method - True Plant Maturation</span></em></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The "mature plants" everyone knew were actually an intermediate state, a cocoon waiting to bloom. The true final result required:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">1000 specific development points</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">One point per day, without exception</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">A three-part ritual that must be performed with absolute precision</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The method was deceptively simple:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">At dawn, the plant must absorb the energy of a common mana crystal drop (can find some on the surface after rains) until it completely dissolves. But it must be processed.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">This energy must mix with a drop of vital essence. During midday, the crystal needs exactly 24 minutes of direct sunlight, not a minute more not a minute less.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">At sunset, finally, the mixture must be "sealed" with golden pollen from Night Flowers, common plants that bloom in 10-day cycles.</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's like daily medicine," Ren thought enthusiastically. "And the components are common enough to never run out."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The key wasn't in the components, but in precision and consistency. One failed day and the process had to restart from zero.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most people who had tried any cultivation with a new method would abandon it after a few months, convinced it wasn't working.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, at the end they had to seal all the accumulated power in the process with an expensive rune.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this case his parents would need a Vitality Rune for the last day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Now I understand why nobody discovers this," murmured Ren. "Everyone knows effective cultivation methods last 150 days maximum. Some extend to six months, but..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The five-month perception was also a misinterpretation. In reality, all methods were only 100 days long, but people wasted time at the beginning trying to find the correct rhythm and getting the mana energy levels wrong.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that he didn't get why they used less mana every day than the most efficient amount… Mana poisoning was scary.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair pulsed softly while he processed this information.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was strange to know so much, every beast…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet even if he could clearly see the evolution paths and cultivation methods up to Silver rank, beyond that... nothing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything related to Gold-rank beasts or higher was an absolute mystery.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Perhaps," he thought, "when my own spore evolves..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was a problem for another time. Now he had to find a way to convince his parents to try something that everyone "knew" was impossible.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A thousand days. A daily mission. Three magical elements.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">No margin for error.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the result... A "truly mature" Iron plant could reach the strength of a Bronze 2 plant. It wouldn't be as versatile as a plant that had naturally evolved to that rank, but its base power would be the same.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their extra vitality would rise from 40% to 100% and they would live longer too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He just needed to convince them to try it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a thousand days.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's like cooking," he murmured, finding an analogy his parents would understand. "You can have the best ingredients, but without the correct recipe..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He sank deeper into the water, watching how the mushrooms in his reflection subtly changed color. There had to be a way to show them he wasn't making up stories.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">To show them he really understood things no ten-year-old should know.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But first, he needed to better understand his own powers. Information about other beasts flowed naturally in his mind, but there were limits. Nebulous frontiers where knowledge faded into uncertainty.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"One step at a time," he whispered, remembering how his father always said that same thing when preparing a particularly complex dish.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Water dripped from the mushrooms in his hair when he finally left the bath. In the foggy old mirror, his reflection stared back: a small, scrawny boy with red hair and green eyes, luminescent mushrooms in his hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nobody would believe that this child could be special.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He would have to prove it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren awoke with the first light, the mushrooms in his hair glowing faintly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 6 days he would leave for school for eight long years, but before leaving, he needed to make sure his parents began the ritual.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He found them in the kitchen, preparing for another day of work. Their faces still showed marks from the previous night's crying.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Mom, Dad," he called their attention, holding dozens of mana crystals. "Before I go to school, could you promise me something?"</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
