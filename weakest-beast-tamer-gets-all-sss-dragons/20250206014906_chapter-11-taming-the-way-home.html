Not in this forest."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The revelation hit him with both frustration and relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, something else gleamed at the edges of this new knowledge, a promise.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When his spore reached Bronze rank, a possibility would open that made his heart beat faster: a second contract.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A second beast.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rest was nebulous, like looking through murky water.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the certainty was there, each evolution of his spore would not only strengthen it but also expand his understanding of beasts and their paths.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I have to go back," he said aloud, this time with determination rather than fear or regret. "I have to get a lot of stuff and start cultivating from the beginning."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair pulsed softly, as if nodding.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was time to return home. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His parents would be worried sick if he arrived too late, and now... now he had a real plan. Not a desperate search, but a clear path.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although first, he'd have to find a way out of this cave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mana density in this cave was insane; Ren would be poisoned if he didn't get out soon.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">How there could be so much mana in a place in the Bronze ring was a mystery to him, even with his expanded knowledge.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He wanted to take some of the enormous mana crystals from the cave, but none were loose, it was a great joint formation, as if it were someone's work from the past rather than something natural. Since it was impossible to break the incredibly hard formations, perhaps he could return to try another time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A mana crystal became much more resistant the larger it grew; he'd need something really powerful to extract it. Much more than a pick, even the Bronze-rank mantis probably couldn't have broken it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Decided to retreat...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren observed the tunnel through which he'd arrived.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ancestral spores were still there, dancing in the darkness with their sickly golden glow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now he saw them differently, understood their nature with astonishing clarity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"They're not aggressive by nature," he murmured, processing the knowledge flowing in his mind. "They attack because they're hungry after centuries of hibernation, but their true method is..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He stopped, an idea forming.</span></p><span class="cjAwNWU0MjJiOGQ5MjQyY2Q4NmIxN2VmMDUwMmMyZTRl"><br>Unauthorized content usage: if you discover this narrative on Amazon, report the violation.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ancestral spores, like all fungi, followed basic behavioral patterns. They sought nutrients, yes, but more importantly: they responded to specific chemical signals.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren took some mud.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"And if I combine this with..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A yellowish mold formed where the ancestral spores fell, as if analyzing its composition...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren closed his eyes, concentrating.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair pulsed, releasing gray spores that mixed with his sweat. It was disgusting, but now he understood the purpose of the information pulsing in his head: the spores from his own beast contained chemical markers that identified him as "part of the colony."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He smeared the mixture on his exposed skin full of spores.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The ancestral spores should recognize me as another fungal colony now," he murmured. "And should keep them at sufficient distance to..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren knelt beside the Mirror Mantis's remains. Under the broken plates and yellowish mold, he could see what he was looking for, the crystalline core, a structure of the beasts that acted as their power center.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the size of his fist.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Beast cores," he whispered, the knowledge unfolding in his mind, "are like concentrated eggs. They contain all the creature's genetic information, its mana patterns, its essence... And there's a way to revive them."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He took some of the mantis's plates, those he could carry in his backpack, and the golden fungus from the ancestral spores that had formed while consuming the mantis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He stepped toward the tunnel. The golden spores swirled around him but didn't attack. To them, he was now just another fungal organism of the same species, not prey.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It works," he whispered, amazed by his own knowledge. "It really works."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">While carefully advancing through the tunnel, Ren couldn't help but smile. A few hours ago, he'd been convinced his spore was useless.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, that same "weakest monster" had given him the knowledge to survive where a Bronze-rank beast had perished.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the core in his hands... anyone else would see it as a mere trophy. But Ren could see its true value: an option to obtain the Mirror Mantis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A creature that, someday, he might need.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ancestral spores tunnel ended up being the easiest stretch of the return journey.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren emerged covered in mud and a mixture of gray and some stray golden spores, but alive and with a valuable treasure in his backpack.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He first cleaned the excess mud and golden spores carefully.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, facing the return path, everything looked different. Where before there was terror and uncertainty, now there was understanding.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Night Excavator tunnels weren't a random maze as he'd thought. "They always dig in spirals," he murmured to himself, recognizing the patterns in the ceiling. "And they mark their active territories with deeper scratches on the eastern walls."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to this, he could avoid zones where other excavators might be active while looking for a less steep trap to exit through.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Emerging into the Moon Toads' zone, he stopped to listen. The melodious croaking came from the distance, but now he understood its meaning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Three ascending tones, they're hunting. Four descending tones would be mating," he whispered. "And they always leave one toad watching escape routes while the others chase prey."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He waited patiently until the croaking pattern changed, indicating the toads had moved away following some nocturnal prey's trail.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only then did he move, keeping to areas where the ground was more compacted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Moon Toads hate hard, dry earth," the knowledge flowed naturally now. "Their feet are designed for soft terrain where they can bury themselves quickly. On firm ground, their bodies lose moisture."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even the natural trap zones were obvious now.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Excavators always left small signs: stones arranged in certain ways, patterns in soil erosion. To untrained eyes they seemed like coincidences, but to Ren now they were like warning signs glowing in the night.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair, still shining with that more intense yellowish tone than before, lit his path as he advanced with renewed confidence. They showed the pattern of the frogs' eyes; Ren was no longer worried about being betrayed by their light, now they even served as camouflage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every step was calculated, every decision informed by knowledge that just hours ago he didn't even know existed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's as if I'd been blind my whole life," he thought while skillfully avoiding a zone that showed clear signs of Toad activity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"And now I can finally see."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The night that had begun as a desperate struggle to survive had become a practical lesson about the true nature of beasts. And his supposed "curse," the weakest spore, turned out to be the key to understanding all these secrets.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The magical forest's end finally appeared before him, the last 'magical trees' glowing (from frog urine) against the night sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren stopped a moment, unconsciously touching the Mantis core in his pack. He had set out seeking a second beast, a miracle to change his destiny.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">What he'd found was something far more valuable: understanding.</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
