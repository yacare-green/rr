Only the base vitality their plants granted them guaranteed an additional thirty years, a precious gift, but not enough in Ren's eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"If they complete the ritual," he murmured, "if their plants reach Bronze 2 power..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">They wouldn't just gain more strength and better job opportunities. The increased vitality would give them several additional decades of life. It would cure his father.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren would see his parents only once a year, if he managed to gather money for the trip. About 100 crystals should be easy to get, or so he thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">What wouldn't be easy would be getting the runes and materials necessary for his own evolution.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it didn't matter, Ren wanted to excel in school and make them proud, maybe even become wealthy and buy them a house in the city. He knew his parents deserved it more than anyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But everything in its time. He would have 2 years to achieve his first goal. 8 years for the second.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eight visits total before graduating. Eight opportunities to verify their progress with the ritual, to ensure they followed each step correctly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the best case, by the third visit already...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The carriage crossed through city streets, taking him further and further from the outskirts where his parents would begin another day of hard work, always believing they were following a meaningless ritual just to make their son happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren's fingers unconsciously traced the Mantis core in his bag, knowledge about his own spore flowing through his mind. Before he could contract it, he would need to turn it into an egg and evolve his fungus to Bronze rank.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">To evolve, he would need:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">First, absorb the essence of death. Charge a Bronze-rank crystal with the moss that grows on discarded bodies of Bronze beasts.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, mix it with venomous spores from Bronze-rank fungi.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, seal the process with the mold that forms on some magical runes when they absorb too much mana.</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had to absorb those expensive processed crystals for 100 days before consuming the final piece.</span></p><span class="cmViZTUzMjJkMGEyNTRkMGNiMzg5OWU4NDc1ZmRkYmEy"><br>If you come across this story on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen from Royal Road. Please report it.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The piece for the final day was the golden fungus in his backpack.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair pulsed softly, as if responding to his thoughts about cultivation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'll show them," whispered Ren, his mushrooms glowing with determination. "I'll show them that their faith in me, even if pretended, wasn't in vain."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The carriage stopped to pick up more students in the commercial district.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren sank into his seat, conscious of the glowing mushrooms in his hair. Before, he would have expelled his spore to hopefully avoid mockery, but now...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The idea of losing that constant flow of knowledge, of returning to ignorance about beasts and their secrets, was unbearable.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A group of three children boarded, their fused beasts already granting them cool visible changes: metallic claws, tiger markings, gleaming scales. They stopped when they saw him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Oh, look who's here," smiled the tallest, a boy with feline features thanks to his tiger beast. "The rotting boy."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Are those... glowing mushrooms on your head?" The group's only girl wrinkled her nose. "Can't you at least hide them? It's disgusting."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Leave him," laughed the third, his green scales gleaming. "He probably can't even control his beast properly. Isn't that right, rotting-boy? Your spore is so weak it has to cling to your head to move."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Laughter filled the carriage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren clenched his fists, knowledge flowing through his mind: the first boy's spirit tiger would reach its limit at Bronze 1 rank, unable to evolve further due to a flaw in its core cultivation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deriving his Spirit Tiger into a "mature" Earthly Tiger. Instead of reaching Greater Spectral Tiger at Silver 3.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl's beast, a Lesser Fire Eagle, had a defect in its mana absorption pattern that would limit its fire control and growth at Bronze 2.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deriving her Lesser Fire Eagle into a "mature" Red Eagle. Instead of reaching Greater Sun Eagle at Silver 3.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the third boy's scales...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that knowledge was useless now.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It only made it more painful, seeing the defects and limitations in their beast cultivation methods but being unable to say anything without seeming crazy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"At least my mushrooms glow," he finally said, his voice firmer than expected. "Your spirit tiger has a cultivation defect that makes its fur opaque."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence fell in the carriage. The tiger boy looked at him with both surprise and fury.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"What did you say?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Nothing," Ren turned back to the window. "Just that maybe you should worry more about your own beast than my mushrooms."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"What do you know about cultivation, rotting-boy?" he growled, his feline features intensifying with anger. "Your pathetic spore doesn't even have true development, doesn't even qualify as a beast."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowledge burned in Ren's mind, tempting him to reveal more, to explain exactly how the tiger's cultivation would affect its future evolution and show him how foolish he was. But he bit his tongue.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm just saying what I see," he murmured.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"What you see?" The boy grabbed him by the shirt collar. "I'll show you what I see, a weakling with mushrooms on his head who needs to be taught his place."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His companions laughed, forming a circle around them. The carriage had suddenly become smaller, more suffocating.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Look, he's even trembling," mocked the eagle girl. "Isn't he adorable?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren wasn't trembling from fear. He was trembling from frustration. He could see their beasts' flaws so clearly: the irregular mana pattern in the eagle's feathers, the instability in the other boy's green scales.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Useless knowledge when you're about to be beaten.</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
