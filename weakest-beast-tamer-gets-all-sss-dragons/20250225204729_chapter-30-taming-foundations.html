'If I start now, before other students finish their classes...'</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Oh! But look who we have here!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren froze mid-step. That cheerful voice...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"My favorite student!" Lin appeared from nowhere, practically materializing in front of him. "What are you doing wandering the halls at this hour? Shouldn't you be in class?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Professor Wei gave me permission to..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Free time!" Lin's eyes sparkled with a joy that made Ren instinctively step back. "What a coincidence! I have this hour free too."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Actually, I was going to the mines to..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Exercise?" Lin grabbed his arm. "How dedicated! I was just thinking you needed more work on your core endurance."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"No, I meant to collect cryst…"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Excellent idea!" Lin began dragging him in the opposite direction from the mines. "We'll collect muscles! Though," she pinched his arm, "first we need to find them. Where did you hide them, little one?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Professor, I really need to get some materials..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Oh, you also need to get some endurance. And look! We have all morning to work on it."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in Ren's hair pulsed with what seemed like resignation while Lin dragged him toward the training field, humming cheerfully.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"You know?" Lin smiled while opening the field door. "I think today we'll focus on leg exercises. Since you seem so eager to go to the mines, I'll help you prepare for all that walking!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren sighed. Apparently, the universe had other plans for his free morning. Very painful plans.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Come on, one last set!" Lin smiled while Ren struggled to complete another series of exercises.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every muscle protested from the previous day's training. The push-ups that were already difficult had become almost impossible.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Can't... can't..." Ren panted, his arms shaking.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Oh?" Lin crouched beside him. "Does the little expert give up so easily? After beating a boy with stone scales?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"That was... different..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"True. That was luck and knowledge," she pinched his cheek. "This is hard work. Which would you prefer backing you up next time?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"All of them!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren tried another push-up, but his arms gave way. The mushrooms in his hair pulsed weakly, as if they too were exhausted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lin watched him struggle a moment longer before sighing theatrically. "Alright, alright. I suppose I've been a bit cruel." She pulled another green pill from her pocket. "Here. This will help with recovery."</span></p><span class="cjgzODYxOTlkNGM5OTQyMTI4OTlhYjAwODRlNDYzYjBm"><br>Unauthorized reproduction: this story has been taken without approval. Report sightings.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"More magic pills?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Nothing magical, just my basic fatigue medicine." She winked. "Can't have my student dying on his second day, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the pill's effect spread through his body, Lin helped him complete the last exercises. The pain didn't disappear completely, but at least now he could move without wanting to scream.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Just in time," Lin heard the bell. "Time for battle class."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Can't I take a break?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"After I gave you a pill?" She dragged him toward the main field. "Besides, today is special, core training for everyone."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The main field was already full when they arrived. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yang watched as students organized themselves in rows.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"After yesterday's evaluations," he announced, "it's clear most need basic strength work. Powerful beasts are useless without a solid foundation."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The exercises that followed were similar to those Lin had made him do, but Ren was already exhausted before starting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Look at the rotting boy!" someone whispered when Ren stumbled during an exercise. "Already tired?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"What did you expect?" another answered between laughs. "With that pathetic spore..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Less talk, more movement!" Lin passed between the rows, correcting postures.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she reached Ren, she murmured: "Don't mind them. They're only doing the exercise once."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren nodded, understanding. While others started fresh, he had two training sessions under his belt. It wasn't that he couldn't do it, he was working triple.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Patinder," Yang called when Ren failed another exercise. "Was yesterday's victory luck after all?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">More laughter. But Ren noticed something in Yang's voice, it wasn't mockery, it was a test.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"No, professor," he stood up, legs shaking. "I'm just working harder than the rest."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Harder?" Jin sneered from his row. "Is that what you call being pathetic?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Continue," Yang ordered, silencing everyone, but Ren caught a slight smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As class progressed, Ren kept pace through pure determination. Lin was right, if he wanted to compete at his best, he needed to work harder than everyone else.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His spore gave him knowledge, but the body to use it... that he would have to earn.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair pulsed stronger, as if approving his resolution. The laughter and mockery continued, but now they felt distant, irrelevant.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn't matter what they said. They only saw the present; he was building his future, one aching muscle at a time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Wasn't so bad," Lin smiled as students left the training field. "You just need to build more endurance."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren, still panting, looked at her incredulously.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Oh, and about mornings..." Lin began collecting training equipment. "Since a certain professor gave you free time, we'll continue with the routine. But," she raised a finger at Ren's horrified expression, "you can dedicate afternoons to collecting crystals."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Really?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Of course. We'll have night training but it'll be lighter, just to maintain the improvement pace." Her playful smile returned. "And I always have more recovery pills."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren didn't know whether to feel relieved or worried.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though the promise of another pill at day's end was tempting...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mei's history class proved surprisingly basic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the professor explained the formation of the first cities and their relationship with low mana concentration zones, Ren found he already knew most of the material. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His old father had liked to tell him all sorts of things...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The first cities were established in areas where mana was low enough to keep powerful beasts away," Mei explained. "That's why our city is where it is, the mana here isn't enough to maintain even Iron-rank beasts without cultivation."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">'And that's why the ruins under the academy are so interesting,' thought Ren while his mushrooms pulsed. A place with dense mana under a naturally mana-poor zone...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally came the crystals gathering class. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Song handed out their mining equipment: small but sturdy picks, basic mana detectors, and special bags for crystals.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Ren!" Min called him as they headed to the caves. "Liu taught us some tricks yesterday. Want us to show you?"</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
