It seemed to have been pure luck and coincidence that he'd mentioned it at all...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He could have perhaps used Liu's argument to make it easier for Taro to accept, but he knew Taro read several books about his beast. Therefore...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">To avoid further discussions and potential interference, Ren had decided to keep this step secret. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fewer questions asked about his methods at this stage, the better.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under the protection of his sheets, he worked with surgical precision. Each grain of the black powder was measured exactly, his movements careful and deliberate. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crystal they had processed with moonlight the previous night reacted immediately upon contact with the black powder, its glow gradually shifting until it acquired an earthy brown tone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The transformation was fascinating to watch, the crystal's inner light seemed to pulse and swirl as it absorbed the powder's properties, like watching soil dissolve into clear water but in reverse. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the kind of subtle interaction that the books missed entirely, focusing instead on dramatic reactions and flashy transformations.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Taro began to stir, showing the first signs of waking, Ren had already completed the crystal's preparation. The timing was perfect, any longer and the sealing might have been too strong, any shorter and it might not have taken properly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Good morning," he smiled, holding the finished crystal. "Your first crystal is ready."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Ah, yes... yes, of course," Taro mumbled, still half-asleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Here," Ren extended the glowing crystal to a barely-awake Taro, who accepted it with sleep-heavy hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still drowsy and trusting, Taro took the crystal without examining its brown glow too closely. After all, he had decided to put his faith in his friend. With a yawn, he activated the absorption process.</span></p><span class="cmRhNzllMWVhOGE4YzQ3MTY4ZjQ3MWRkYjAwYTMwMmEy"><br>The tale has been illicitly lifted; should you spot it on Amazon, report the violation.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, nothing happened. The room remained still, the early morning light casting long shadows across the floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the mana began to flow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taro's eyes flew wide open as the first wave of power coursed through him. It was more intense than he had expected, far more potent than the practice crystals he had used before. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sensation was like plunging into icy water, shocking, overwhelming, yet somehow invigorating.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another wave hit, stronger than the first. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And another. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And another.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each pulse of power seemed to build on the last, creating a cascading effect that made Taro's entire body hum with energy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"This is..." Taro gasped as the power continued to surge. "It's too much..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Liu leaped from his bed the moment he saw Taro's veins begin to glow with an unmistakable blue radiance, the telltale sign of mana poisoning. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blue lines traced patterns under his skin like rivers of light.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"What have you done?!" Liu lunged toward Ren, panic evident in his voice. "I told you they were overcharged! Look at his veins!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blue lines were spreading rapidly across Taro's arms, who now struggled for breath. The mana flowed uncontrolled through his system, far too much for his body to process normally. Each pulse made the glow brighter, more intense.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We need to get him to the infirmary," Liu was already searching frantically for his shoes. "Mana poisoning medicine is expensive, but if he doesn't get it soon..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Wait," Ren maintained his composure, though his eyes never left Taro. His calm seemed almost unnatural in the face of such danger.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Wait?! He's having massive poisoning because of you!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Min had also awakened to the commotion and watched the scene with growing concern, his water snake coiling anxiously around his arm.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Just..." Ren raised a hand, "wait one more moment."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taro's veins now shone with increasing intensity, his breathing had become erratic, and sweat beaded on his forehead. Every sign pointed to a severe case of mana poisoning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Easy," Ren gripped Taro's shoulders firmly. "Breathe with me. Slowly."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The mana..." Taro panted, the blue lines pulsing brilliantly beneath his skin.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's a lot, I know," Ren's voice remained calm, controlled. "But your beetle can handle it. You just need to guide it correctly."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Liu watched from the door, torn between running for help and the strange certainty in Ren's demeanor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Feel the flow," Ren continued. "Notice how it's pooling in your chest? You need to move it. Make it circulate to your arms first."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taro nodded weakly, focusing on the sensation. Slowly, the blue lines in his arms began to fade as he directed the energy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Good. Now, let some flow toward your back. Your beetle is an earth creature, the mana should feel more natural flowing downward."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Min held his breath as he watched the blue lines shift and gradually weaken, following Taro's control.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Temporary mana excess isn't bad if you know how to control it," Ren explained while guiding Taro. "Your beast is designed for this, it just needs you to help distribute it properly."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gradually, Taro's breathing normalized. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blue lines almost completely vanished, leaving only a faint glow under his skin that looked more healthy than dangerous.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"How do you feel?" Ren asked after several minutes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's... different," Taro flexed his fingers, surprised. "I feel stronger, more connected to my beetle. Is this normal?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's how it should be," Ren smiled, finally releasing his shoulders. "Traditional crystals have less mana to avoid poisoning. But your beetle can handle more to shorten the period by much, as long as you guide it correctly."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Liu had approached again, his expression split between amazement and skepticism. "How did you know it would work?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Because I know beasts better than the books suggest," Ren replied simply. "And this is only the first day."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taro stood up, experimenting with his new sensation of power. Not only had he survived the apparent poisoning, he felt better than ever.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first crystal had worked exactly as Ren had planned.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ninety-nine more, and the beetle's evolution would be undeniable.</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
