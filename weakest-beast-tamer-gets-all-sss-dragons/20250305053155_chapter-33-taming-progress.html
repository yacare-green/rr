Lin watched in surprise as Ren completed the last series of morning exercises without his usual gasping.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The training field was empty except for them, as it had been every morning for the past month.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But something was different today.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It seems the pills have helped more than I expected," Lin murmured, studying her student with professional interest. "His recovery is... remarkable."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was true. The exercises that once left him on the verge of collapse were now, though still challenging, manageable. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A month of constant training and recovery pills had transformed his endurance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Well," Lin smiled, an expression Ren had learned to fear. "I suppose it's time to move to the next level."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Next level?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We can finally begin with some real technique," Lin positioned herself in front of him. "Until now we've just been building your physical foundation. But now that you can move without looking like a newborn kitten..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She moved into a stance Ren didn't recognize.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Technique is more than just strength," she explained. "It's understanding how to use your body efficiently. Watch."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her movement was so fluid that Ren could barely follow it. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In an instant, she was in front of him; in the next, she had twisted in a way that seemed to defy gravity and appeared behind him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Your spore only gives you 10% more strength," she continued. "But with proper training and technique, you can make that 10% worth much more."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the next hour, Lin guided him through basic movements. How to position his feet, how to distribute weight, how to use an opponent's momentum.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Most students depend too much on their beasts," she explained while correcting his posture. "They think a 30% or 50% increase in strength makes them invincible. But technique..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She moved again, this time more slowly so Ren could observe.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Technique can overcome brute force. It's what's kept me as a teacher here, even with my crane stuck in Bronze."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren tried to replicate the movement, stumbling in the process.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I don't expect you to master it today," Lin laughed while helping him up. "But at least now you have the endurance to practice without hurting yourself so easily."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As they continued practicing, Ren noticed that the movements, though somewhat complex, weren't as exhausting as he'd expected. A month ago, simply maintaining the stance would have left him drained.</span></p><span class="cjQwYWY4NzU1OGIyNjQwOTViZGI2ZmYxODkyMDdjYTgx"><br>If you encounter this tale on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">'The pills have really worked wonders, though I suppose his determination has helped too. Not everyone gets up every time they fall for a whole month.'</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren smiled, grateful for his teacher's support.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His knowledge had shown him that the pills used somewhat expensive Bronze-level materials that helped with muscle regeneration and energy. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As thanks, he would help improve her "mature" beast further, show that "weak" beasts weren't weak, that the records were mostly wrong... And soon, with Taro's evolution, he would have the first real proof of that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Enough for today," Lin finally announced.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Tomorrow we'll start working seriously on these techniques. Now that your body can keep up, we'll see how fast your mind can learn."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As he headed to his next class, Ren reflected on how much had changed in a month. His muscles no longer protested with every movement, his endurance had improved significantly, and now, finally, he would begin learning real techniques.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe Lin was right, tomorrow everything would begin in earnest... But it was just the beginning. With the processing of Taro's crystals that night, soon he would have much more to work with.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Battle class proceeded normally, still exercising for everyone, as did Professor Mei's class, which was history today. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, in crystal class...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"As you can see," Professor Song pointed at the tunnel walls, "productive veins are becoming increasingly scarce."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He wasn't exaggerating.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where a month ago crystals glittered everywhere, now only dull marks remained in the rock. The few deposits that remained active were smaller and more scattered.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Therefore," Song continued, "we'll soon change the focus of the class. There's no point bringing you here when the veins need time to regenerate."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Min raised his hand. "How long does complete regeneration take?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"That," Song smiled, "is exactly the kind of question we'll be studying. We'll move to theory of other crystal types and begin extra preparation for exterior gathering classes coming mid-next month."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Several students, especially those from wealthier families, looked relieved. For them, mining expeditions had been more of a nuisance than a necessity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"However," Song added, "those who wish to continue practical gathering can keep using the mines. You just need to report your findings, we'll use that data for regeneration time studies like every year."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">After class, while most headed to the library, Ren and his companions remained in the tunnels.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Did you notice there are fewer guards?" Taro whispered while they worked on a minor vein.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was true. The guards who previously patrolled every level now concentrated mainly at the entrances and deeper zones.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Normal," Liu joined them, arriving from his own class. "With fewer students in the mines, they don't need as much supervision. Most prefer studying theory to picking at rock for crumbs."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren looked around. The only ones left were students like them, those who needed every crystal they could find, from less wealthy families.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no sign of Klein or his group, and even Jin seemed to have lost interest in harassing them in the tunnels.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's better this way," Min extracted a small crystal. "More space to work."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"And less competition for the remaining veins," added Taro.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Though we'll soon have to consider deeper zones," murmured Ren, studying the mana patterns. "The upper levels are almost depleted."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Liu frowned. "Guards still watch those areas."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"But with less personnel," Ren pointed out. "And the patrols are more predictable now."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Are you suggesting...?" Taro began.</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
