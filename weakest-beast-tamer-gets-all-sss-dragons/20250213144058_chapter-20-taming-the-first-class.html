Afterward, you'll be reorganized according to your performance, so pay attention if you don't want to lose your place... I'll begin the class."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren observed the patterns on the professor's skin. The manticore had been cultivated primarily with random daylight, there were details suggesting other unused techniques.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wei began drawing a diagram on the board.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The basic principles of cultivation have been studied for hundreds of years," Professor Wei began. "Every successful method follows three fundamental phases and has a proven maximum duration."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He drew three circles on the board.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"First, mana absorption. The beast must receive energy appropriate to its nature. Second, processing, how that energy is transformed in the crystal so the mana is suitable. And finally, fixation, how that power is stabilized and made permanent."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wei made a significant pause.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Something crucial you must understand: no effective cultivation method lasts more than six months. This is a fact proven through countless studies. The most common methods last 150 days, and although some charlatans propose longer processes, the evidence is clear, after six months, any cultivation attempt becomes inefficient or downright useless."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren shifted uneasily in his seat. He knew why this perception was also wrong, all methods without exception were 100 days, but...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Luna Starweaver," Wei pointed. "Could you explain how these phases apply in practice?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"In practice," Luna stood, her shadow wolf manifesting in her like a dark silhouette with its own life, "first we must obtain the appropriate mana crystals. These are processed, in the case of shadow beasts like mine, under moonlight. Then they're sealed with specific techniques before the beast can absorb them."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Correct," Wei nodded. "The type of crystal, the processing method, in your case moonlight, and the sealing determine the final effectiveness when the beast absorbs it and lead it to the correct path of its potential."</span></p><span class="cjgzNTRjNWQ3NmI3ODRjNDg4ZmU5NmRjM2EyYjk0MTI4"><br>Unlawfully taken from Royal Road, this story should be reported if seen on Amazon.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Excuse me, professor," Ren couldn't contain himself. "But that's not entirely accurate. About crystal processing..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence fell like a slab. Even the tiger boy seemed to forget his hostility, too surprised by the 'Rotting Boy's' audacity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Oh?" Wei turned slowly and looked at him with evident annoyance. "The student with the spore has something to contribute about cultivation?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Contained laughter.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Mana crystals must be processed differently than broad cases like 'moonlight', they need to be more specific. For example, Luna’s wolf crystals shouldn't just be at night, but on a night with 7 moons. Another example would be your manticore, which could have benefited from crystals processed under the first light of dawn, it would have reached Silver 3 instead of..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Enough," Wei cut him off. "I see we have another 'expert' who thinks he knows more than generations of research. Young man, I studied for thirty years before cultivating this manticore. We reached Silver rank 2 following methods proven by generations. To suggest that..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wei straightened, his golden patterns glowing with irritation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Five points less for the student... what's your name?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Ren Patinder, sir."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">More laughter, now open.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Not that it matters much," Wei smiled maliciously. "I doubt a spore will obtain many resources from the Academy anyway."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"But..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Enough," Wei cut him off again. "I understand some students try to compensate for their... limitations with extravagant theories. But in this class, we'll stick to proven methods..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The texts have been proven by generations," Wei frowned. "To suggest they're wrong based on... what exactly? Readings in a story?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Laughter filled the classroom. The tiger boy and his friends practically glowed with satisfaction.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luna, however, watched the scene with intense interest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren clenched his fists under his desk. Not only had he lost points he didn't even have yet, he could lose the opportunity to gain the support he so desperately needed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reaching 100 points in this class by the end of the semester would now be a bit more difficult.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I need a way to prove I'm right, he thought while the mushrooms in his hair pulsed softly. Something irrefutable. Something not even Professor Wei can deny.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The answer had to be somewhere. And he had to find it before his opportunity to obtain resources vanished completely.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren sank in his seat. He hadn't expected wrong knowledge to be so deeply rooted. How could he prove he was right when everything they knew contradicted the truth?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Let's continue," Wei returned to the board. "As I was saying, basic cultivation follows simple rules..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was going to be harder than Ren thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rest of the class was torture. Every time Wei asked a question, he deliberately ignored Ren's raised hand. When he finally did call on him, it was only to say:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"See, this is how you answer, with established facts, not absurd theories."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"As we can see in historical records," Wei continued, pointing to Taro, "the digger beetle is a classic example of a beast with mediocre natural limits. None has surpassed Bronze rank in the more than 500 years we have of species documentation."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren saw how Taro's shoulders slumped. His roommate had a ton of books, he seemed to have been studying cultivation methods at home, hoping to find some exception.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had thought about telling him what he knew but decided to wait until he knew him better. However, now...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren straightened in his seat. This was his opportunity.</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
