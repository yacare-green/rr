It's the first time I've seen someone win a fight while looking so adorably pathetic," she laughed, her eyes sparkling with amusement. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Your form is terrible, darling. Your endurance..." she clicked her tongue, "well, let's say any novice with any other beast would have more stamina, and your technique..." she shook her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Practically nonexistent."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren tried to sit up, every muscle protesting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Ah, ah," Lin gently pushed him back to the bed. "Boys who let themselves be used as training dummies need to rest a bit while listening."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I didn't let..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"No?" she arched an eyebrow, amused. "Oh, sorry. I suppose your face and body heroically stopped all those blows on purpose."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the pain, Ren couldn't help blushing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"But..." Lin leaned forward, her smile becoming softer, "your combat reading was fascinating. The way you analyzed Kai's scales, how you found the weak point in his mana pattern... That was extraordinary."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Why are you here, professor?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Can't I visit my new favorite student?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Your... what?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I want to train you personally."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren blinked, sure he had heard wrong.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Train me? But..." he looked at the mushrooms in his hair reflected in the window. "I have the weakest beast. Even if I improve my technique, my limit is..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"And?" Lin smiled, but there was something bitter in her expression. "Let me show you something."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lin rolled up her sleeve with a theatrical flourish. "Look at this."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">On her arm, white and red feathers gleamed under the light. A swift crane manifested in her skin, its wings forming elegant patterns that ran up to her shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"A swift crane," Ren observed, the mushrooms in his hair pulsing with knowledge. "But the feather pattern..."</span></p><span class="cjgyZTRiZjA1N2UyODQ5OTY4MGUyMzExYzE5YjQ0MzEx"><br>Love what you're reading? Discover and support the author on the platform they originally published on.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lin traced the feathers with a finger.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Most cranes can reach Silver easily. They're creatures naturally gifted for cultivation, with a clear path to higher ranks."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sat on the edge of the bed, her eyes lost in the feather patterns.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Mine was especially promising thanks to my family's resources. The professors said it had potential for Silver 2, maybe even..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Well… Pretty impressive, right? Or it was, until this fool," she pointed to herself, "ruined her cultivation through impatience."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in Ren's hair pulsed as he analyzed. The pattern clearly showed where the cultivation had deviated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Now it's permanently at Bronze 1 having reached maturity," Lin continued, pinching Ren's cheek. "So let's say I have a weakness for special cases."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Why me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Because..." she leaned in so close their noses almost touched, "I saw a little genius today. Sure, a genius who desperately needs physical training, but..." she winked, "that can be fixed."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren saw a flash of pity in her eyes, though she hid it well behind her playful attitude. And she was right, even a mature beast, ruined at Bronze 1, was infinitely superior to his spore.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least in others' perception, since he knew the truth... However, Ren could certainly use some extra training...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"So, what do you say?" Lin ruffled his hair, making the mushrooms glow. "Will you let this ruined assistant professor train the weakest student?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms glowed as Ren considered her offer. The knowledge showed him that Lin's swift crane could have been extraordinary... and that it wasn't completely lost yet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I accept," he said finally. "But..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"But?" Lin tilted her head, curious.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Someday," Ren looked at the feathers on her arm, "I'd like to talk to you about your crane's cultivation."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lin blinked, surprised, before letting out a crystalline laugh.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"How daring!" she pinched both his cheeks this time. "The little expert wants to fix my cultivation? One thing at a time, darling. First," her smile turned mischievous, "let's see if you can last more than two minutes in a real fight."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The teacher stood up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Well, enough rest," Lin pulled a small green pill from her pocket. "Take this, it will help with the pain and speed up your recovery."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren swallowed the pill, feeling a pleasant warmth spread through his body. The pain didn't disappear completely, but it became more manageable.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Now, to class," Lin helped him up. "You have practical Economics after battle class, and you can't afford to miss it. With your... special condition, you need to excel in all theoretical units if you want to maintain your support."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren nodded, understanding where the advice came from. Lin believed that with his spore, he would need every point he could get.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'll see you after classes," Lin smiled as she gently pushed him toward the door. "And this time try not to provoke anyone who might break your bones before you heal, okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair pulsed softly as Ren headed to his next class. The lingering pain reminded him that, despite his victory, he still had a long way to go.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren arrived limping to the economics classroom. Professor Mei was already in the middle of her explanation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"...that's why understanding crystal economy cycles is crucial," she was saying while drawing graphs on the board. "The value fluctuates according to the season. Rain crystals, for example, are cheaper during the wet season..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taro waved to him from his seat, pointing to an empty space beside him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Smart merchants," Mei continued, "buy when prices are low and store. But they must consider storage costs and degradation risk..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Mr. Patinder," Mei stopped, her voice sharp. "Is punctuality not important for...?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Professor," Luna interrupted from her seat, her voice cold and precise...</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
