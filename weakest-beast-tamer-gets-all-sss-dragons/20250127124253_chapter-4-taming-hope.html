"Eight years watching others evolve their beasts while he... while our foolish investment takes away his hope for..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He didn't need to finish the sentence. A spore couldn't evolve its rank.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were no cultivation techniques to study, no improvement paths to explore, no secret techniques to buy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many had already tried.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Richer people with much more support.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only one who succeeded... </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was labeled as the worst failure. A fortune spent for an almost useless gain, 20% strength.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since that day, the spore has been the symbol of failure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren would spend eight years learning things he could never apply, his surroundings a constant reminder of what he couldn't achieve.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eight years of mockery, being the school's laughingstock.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eight wasted years, because what could he learn about cultivation and evolution with a creature that couldn't even evolve?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sadness led the father to reminisce about the past, a past that Ren had illuminated...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Remember that day?" he asked suddenly, his gaze lost in the candle flames. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"When I couldn't find the medicine demanded by the kingdom because it was depleted due to severe mana contamination from that year's horde, and I had to go out searching for a mana poisoning cure and also found that plant you ate... We thought we had been blessed."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She nodded, taking his hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">How could she forget?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">They had been trying to have a child since their twenties. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost three decades of broken hopes, watching their friends form families while they remained alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">They had lived a frugal life, pooling their resources to form a happy family, interested only in one thing they couldn't obtain no matter how much they accumulated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost a million, an incredible amount for citizens of their rank.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">They'd thought about using the money to "cure" their infertility but they were already so old... They had given up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that trip to the outskirts...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The plant I found in the outskirts, mistaking it for that high-quality 100-year-old sweet root..." he continued. "When you ate it, I thought... I thought I had killed you. You were so pale, so cold..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"And a week later, I felt like I was twenty again," she smiled sadly. "And the following year we succeeded without trying..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Our miracle."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">They fell silent, listening to the muffled sobs coming from Ren's room.</span></p><span class="cmVhMDZjNjQ2NTJjMzRmZDQ4OTlmNDkyYzYwZGQyYWNk"><br>You might be reading a stolen copy. Visit Royal Road for the authentic version.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their little miracle, the child who had given them so much life and happiness when they had almost lost hope, now faced a cruel destiny.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's as if the dragon gods were mocking us," she murmured. "They gave us a child when we were already too old, only to..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"To watch him suffer," he completed, squeezing her hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The candles, almost spent, continued burning, their flames reflecting on the school contract on the table.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the adjacent room, their ten-year-old son cried silently, a small gray spore floating beside his pillow like a constant reminder of his fate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feast they had prepared with so much love slowly cooled on the table, untouched, while two elderly parents wept for the cruel turn their life's miracle had taken.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren lay on his bed, tears drying on his cheeks while rage gradually replaced sadness.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The spore floated nearby, its weak gray glow only serving to enrage him more.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Go to school like this? It was a cruel joke.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He could already see the next eight years unfolding before him like an endless nightmare. While other children would learn to evolve their beasts, to awaken new powers, he would sit there, with a creature that couldn't even mature properly...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it would be better to do what other unfortunate "rotting ones" did and...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">No!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He couldn't, he loved his parents and they loved him too much too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He needed to find something to distract himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He turned to the small bookshelf beside his bed, where he kept his favorite book, worn from countless readings: "The Second Contract of the Wandering King."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His fingers traced the worn cover, following the image of a legendary warrior who had achieved the impossible.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the story, the hero had found a mystical medicine deep in the forest, something that had allowed him to form a second contract with a beast.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just a tale, of course, in all recorded history, only the current king and a dozen legendary warriors had managed to obtain a second creature contracted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And none of them would reveal the way to achieve it to the masses.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Ren was still a child, still naive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren looked through his window toward the dark forest stretching beyond the outskirts. The medicine from the story... What if...?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the thought died as quickly as it arose. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His father, with his mature Iron-rank plant, had returned half-dead the only time he ventured there.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And he had real advantages: A great 40% extra vitality, an adult's strength and speed increased by 20%, along with all his other attributes, a modest control over plants that allowed him to detect dangers and defend against some monsters, plus years of experience.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And what did Ren have? </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A useless spore and a miserable 10% increase to his childish strength. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He couldn't even lift the heavier flour sacks in the kitchen, how did he expect to survive in a forest full of monsters?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The spore flickered weakly, as if sensing his desperation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Why you?" he whispered bitterly toward the creature. "With such low chances... why did it have to be you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence was his only answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the dining room, he could hear his parents talking in low voices, their voices laden with worry. He couldn't bear it anymore. He couldn't be the cause of their pain, the pathetic end to all their hopes and sacrifices.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But he couldn't change anything either.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the contract was formed, it was for life. The spore would be his companion until the day he died, a constant reminder of his failure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unless...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His eyes fixed again on the dark forest beyond his window.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even considering it was suicidal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mana poisoning would kill him in less than 3 days with such a weak creature in his body.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But as he thought about the school contract, about the years of torment awaiting him...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was worse? Dying while trying to change his destiny or living eight years as the school's laughingstock?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His parents... Maybe he could make them happy too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren opened his worn book once more, his fingers tracing the illustrations of the Dragons.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was believed that all creatures could become dragons by finding the right path of cultivation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the book, the Wandering King found much information alongside his medicine...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn't just any medicine he wanted, it was in the heart of dragon territory, where mana flowed so densely it could be seen in the air.</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
