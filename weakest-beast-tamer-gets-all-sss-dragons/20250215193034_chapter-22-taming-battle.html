"I promise."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"With the 100 crystals you have it will be more than enough if we overcharge them. The error in the extra 50 days is in the reduced amount of mana in the night crystal, the beetle adapts to the error late, 50 days late..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"...Though I understand why they don't use larger crystals, mana poisoning is scary, but I hope you'll let me slightly increase the amount," Ren smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We just need to wait for a specific night that's coming in a few days so they don't absorb the wrong moons’ light and the evolution doesn't stray from the correct path."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taro looked at Ren for a long moment. The mushrooms in his hair glowed with a steady light, as if reflecting the certainty in his words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could he believe this child with such terrible luck? Actually, his logic told him no. But subconsciously, Ren's overwhelming confidence gave him tiny hopes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"You know what?" Taro finally smiled. "I hadn't started the mixture with the night essence anyway. I was waiting to have all the crystals to do it at once, so..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He shrugged.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I guess I lose nothing by doing it your way, 500-year of records won't change to give my beetle another option if the professor was so sure there wasn’t... And if you're wrong about the amount when overcharging the crystal, the school will give me the potion for poisoning once… at least that support is universal."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm telling you, you won't need any of that," Ren repeated and laughed at Taro's worried monologue.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Yes, yes... But if you're wrong, nothing will happen to me anyway, that's why I'm calm, and I'd still have time to collect the other 50 crystals to finish the common method, though we'll have to dig... They'll only give us one Iron-rank crystal daily and it's not an earth attribute... Though after using 100 for 100 days, I'm sure I'll already have another 50 just in case."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Hahaha, you talk and worry too much..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As they walked to their next class, Ren noticed something.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"By the way, why didn't you collect rain crystals? They're cheaper but you could have exchanged them; I had 500 before coming... I even got 15 in the last few weeks thanks to the rains."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"In the city?" Taro laughed without humor. "It's almost impossible to find them here. Besides, my beetle needs earth crystals, which are much more expensive. Plant users are lucky, they can use that basic and super cheap crystal in their first rank."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren nodded, thoughtful. He would also need earth crystals for his evolution, though of a higher rank than Taro's...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As they walked toward combat class, Ren and Taro met Min in the hallway.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Did you hear?" Min smiled, his water snake undulating around his neck. "Professor Yang has a Stone Behemoth. A Behemoth! There are only three in the whole city."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren, Min, and Taro had reached the end of the hallway, to the next class.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The combat classroom was different from the others...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A circular amphitheater with an arena in the center, surrounded by ascending stands. The walls were marked with scars from past battles.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Silence!" Professor Yang's voice thundered in the amphitheater. He was a tall, muscular man, with scars that spoke of years of real experience.</span></p><span class="cmQwODZjZTgxY2QzMTQwMDhhZGQ0MGIxMmJlZjQ4MWFm"><br>If you encounter this narrative on Amazon, note that it's taken without the author's consent. Report it.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The stone Behemoth in Professor Yang's skin gleamed under the amphitheater lights. The rocky lines covering his muscles made him look carved from living granite, a perfect manifestation for a combat instructor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Welcome to the real reason the government has you in school!" Professor Yang smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Though before we begin with the important stuff," Yang approached the board, "I see in your faces that no one has explained how this school really works. Typical of old Wei."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Since... my colleague was probably too busy with theories to explain the basics to you, let me simplify your five teaching units."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He drew five circles on the board.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The Academy divides its teaching into five units. Each is worth one point, and you need at least three to maintain your support here. Losing three points, three times in a row, means you're a failure not worth cultivating."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He pointed to the first circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"</span><strong>First</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">, basic knowledge: history, economics, and life. Three boring but necessary subjects, without them you wouldn't even know how to pay your taxes." Several students laughed. "Passing all three counts as one unit."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Several students were taking notes frantically.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He pointed to the </span><strong>second </strong><span style="font-weight: 400">section.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Then there's Professor Wei's theoretical classes: cultivation and crystal processing. Another unit. Yes, they're important," he rolled his eyes, "but theory alone won't keep you alive."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His tone suggested he considered this barely more useful than the basic classes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The </span><strong>third </strong><span style="font-weight: 400">unit is exterior gathering, where you'll learn something useful. They'll teach you to survive while searching for cultivation materials. Two weeks every two months, we'll go to designated zones. You'll learn to identify materials, detect monsters, and most importantly... when to fight and when to flee."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in Ren's hair glowed with interest as Yang continued:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"</span><strong>Fourth</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> unit: practical crystals. Not endless theories, but real identification and gathering in the caves. Also a respectable unit. You'll learn to distinguish qualities, purity, and most importantly... not to poison yourselves too often by exposing yourself too much to concentrated mana."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He straightened.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"And </span><strong>finally</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">... </span><strong>Combat</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">. My specialty is battle against monsters."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A young woman entered the classroom, her light step contrasting with Yang's imposing presence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"My assistant, Professor Lin, is expert in combat against other tamers."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His eyes swept the class.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"And do you know why this is the most important unit? Because no matter how much theory you memorize, how many crystals you identify or how many materials you collect... if you can't defend yourself, all that knowledge will die with you."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rock in his skin crackled, as if emphasizing his words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Outside, monsters won't wait for you to process your crystals correctly. And in the rival city... Some 'humans' can be just as dangerous."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren sank a bit in his seat. With only a 10% increase in strength, this unit would be a brutal unit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"This class," his voice was rough as the stone covering him, "will determine your baseline."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He walked to the center of the arena.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The final exam is simple: you'll have to eliminate a real monster. Not one of those weak ones that prowl near the city, but a genuine beast from the outer zones."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Murmurs filled the amphitheater.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"That's why I need to know where you stand. Professor Lin and I will design a specific training program for each of you, based on your performance today."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Professor Lin began unrolling a scroll.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We'll pair you according to your beasts and attributes. The goal is to show your current capabilities."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yang nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Some of you have strength increases, others speed. Some have beasts with special abilities. But now, before cultivating them is when your individualities as people can matter more than your beasts. We want to see how you use them, how you think in combat..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Ah, and one more thing," Yang smiled. "In my class, theory is learned through bruises."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in Ren's hair pulsed nervously. His 10% increase in strength seemed insignificant compared to his classmates' beasts. Even in the early stages.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"First pair," Lin read from the scroll, "Jin and..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tiger boy straightened, his eyes fixed on Ren, waiting for his opportunity.</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
