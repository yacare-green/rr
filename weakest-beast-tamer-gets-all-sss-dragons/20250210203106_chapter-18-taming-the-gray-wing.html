They hadn't had one in decades.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dormitory was spacious but austere, designed for four students.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His roommates were already there: Min, a thin boy with a water snake; Taro, more robust, with a digger beetle; and Liu, tall and quiet, with a night bat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">All Iron-rank beasts, yes, but at least they had evolution potential up to Bronze.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or that's what everyone believed, but Ren could see their cultivation routes up to Silver 3 like all other beasts.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The mushroom boy," Min smiled when Ren entered. There was no malice in his voice, just a kind of resigned camaraderie. "I guess it makes sense they put us together."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren dropped his bag on the last available bed, aware of the curious glances toward the mushrooms in his hair and the bruise on his eye.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Your spore... does it do anything besides glow?" asked Taro.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren hesitated. After the incident in the carriage, he didn't want to draw more attention to himself. "It gives a 10% increase to my strength," he said simply. "And it has something good... I don't need lamps."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">More pitying looks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">An uncomfortable silence followed his words. The others exchanged glances, the kind you give someone who won't accept a painful truth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Hey," Min tried to sound cheerful, "it's not so bad. Liu's bat has good perception," Taro added. "Not everything is about pure power."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"You're right, it's not so bad," Liu said from his corner. "I'm a second-year student but I failed 2 units, that's why I'm still in this dormitory. My first year here taught me that initial rank isn't everything. My bat seemed useless at first, but with the right training..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Liu shared advice about life in the Gray Wing, Ren observed his companions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He could clearly see how Min's snake needed freshwater instead of saltwater in its crystals to develop its true potential, how Taro's beetle needed to be fed processed crystals during a specific moon phase to advance along the correct path and not mature.</span></p><span class="cjZiNGNjNDc1NzE0OTRhMjliZGU3YmE3OWUyNmNlYzVi"><br>A case of theft: this story is not rightfully on Amazon; if you spot it, report the violation.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps, he thought, when they knew each other better, when they trusted each other... he could share some of his knowledge.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least enough to help them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">While unpacking, the mushrooms in his hair pulsed with that strange rhythm again. There was something under the Gray Wing, something ancient. Maybe being in the "worst" dormitory wasn't so bad after all.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially if what he sensed was correct, and the ancient ruins extended right beneath their feet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Liu," Ren approached the second-year student after the others began organizing their things.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Where can I get discarded monster parts? You know, cores, beast remains, materials, Bronze crystals, and..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Liu stopped organizing his trunk and looked at Ren with both pity and amusement.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Straight to the point, huh?" he sighed. "Look, a few years ago, the Academy distributed resources equitably. Every student received what they needed to try evolving their beast, regardless of potential rank, to search for possible hidden cultivation paths."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He sat on his bed, his night bat fluttering restlessly above his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"But everything changed. Now it works on a merit system. You have to prove you're worth investing in." Liu grimaced. "Basic support is miserable, barely enough for decent beasts to reach Bronze rank with great effort… one measly crystal daily."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"But I need those materials," Ren insisted. "Especially venomous fungi, Bronze parts, and runes with…"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Runes?" Liu let out a dry laugh. "Those are extremely expensive. They only give them to elite beasts, ones with real potential, and only for passing from Silver to Gold... The rest have to earn them with results." He looked at the mushrooms in Ren's hair. "No offense, but nobody's going to waste resources like that on a spore."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Why not?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Because experiments with fungi always fail. Always. The school keeps records of every attempt. The best result was a mature fungus that gave a 20% strength increase, and it cost more resources than evolving three normal beasts to Silver."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren clenched his fists. If Liu knew what he knew now, if he could explain the true evolution paths...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"But there are other ways to get resources," Liu murmured.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"There's the teaching unit system," he continued. "If you manage to pass all five units this semester, they'll promote you from Iron to Bronze 1. Instead of one crystal daily, you'd receive ten."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Ten times more?" Ren's eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"At Silver 1 it would be a hundred," Liu gave a dry laugh. "But that's not until fourth semester, and only if you pass the first three without failing any units." He looked at the mushrooms in Ren's hair. "Though honestly, I doubt you'll achieve much in the battle unit. And cultivation..." he shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"What happens if I fail?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Every three failed units you lose a point. If you lose three points..." Liu made a cutting gesture with his hand. "Goodbye to all support. The most you can do is try to pass three units and avoid getting expelled from the system."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren nodded slowly, processing the information. The system was brutal but the rewards...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Listen," Liu leaned forward. "I'm telling you this because I like you and honestly feel a bit sorry for you. Don't get your hopes up. Focus on surviving the eight years. Learn what you can. But don't expect miracles."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"If I were you," Liu lowered his voice, "I'd focus on recovering part of what tuition cost. The fees are high, but with enough work in the gathering zones you could get them to double your resources and recover at least a fifth part in the next 8 years."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Double? How does that work?" Ren asked.</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
