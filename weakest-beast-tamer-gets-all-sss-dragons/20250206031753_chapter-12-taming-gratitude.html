Perhaps he could slip in through his window and...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A movement in the darkness made him freeze.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment he thought they were frogs expelled from their territory. Dangerous, as so hungry and lacking mana they would act differently than normal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two silhouettes moved near the forest's edge, one carrying a dim lamp. Even at this distance, he recognized the way they moved, not monsters, but his parents.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His father led the way, hoe in one hand and his mature plant ready for combat. His mother followed close behind, her own vines subtly spreading across the ground, prepared for defense.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, it would have obviously revealed his path and pointed the exact way he'd gone…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The map.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as they realised Ren wasn't in his room...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His father would have noticed the map's absence immediately. How many times had he seen Ren studying it, asking details about that desperate adventure in search of medicine?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was obvious where a child who had just received the weakest spore would look for hope.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren watched them move in the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite their basic beasts, they moved with the coordination that only years of working together could give. He had seen them like this before, in the kitchen, working in perfect synchronization.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His new knowledge let him see more of it. How his father's plant extended in specific ways to detect movement, how his mother's vines created precise defensive patterns with the surrounding roots.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even with only mature Iron-rank beasts, they had developed effective techniques.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair glowed more intensely. He was tired, covered in mud and gray spores, but alive. And now he would have to face what was coming.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had no choice…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He took a step toward the light.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just one...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The yellowish glow of the mushrooms in his hair betrayed him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"There!" his father whispered. "A frog so close to the prairie could have attacked Ren!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The vines moved with surprising speed, and Ren felt the familiar grip of his mother's plants wrapping around him. For a moment, he considered explaining how mature Iron-rank vines had a growth pattern that...</span></p><span class="cmM4YTc5MzA1MjZkYzQwNzViNzMwMjU1MzYwNjZhY2M1"><br>You might be reading a stolen copy. Visit Royal Road for the authentic version.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"REN!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His mother's cry cut through his thoughts. The vines loosened instantly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren prepared for the worst. He now knew the biology of dozens of beasts, understood the most complex behavioral patterns, but had no idea how to handle what was coming.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The punishment would be severe, he knew.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had stolen his father's precious map, had run away in the middle of the night, had...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His mother reached him first, practically knocking him over with the force of her embrace. His father arrived a second later, enveloping them both in his arms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were... </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Crying?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"My child," his mother sobbed, squeezing him so tight he could barely breathe. "My little one..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We thought..." his father couldn't finish the sentence, his voice breaking.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren stood rigid, waiting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any moment the shouting would begin, the scolding, the punishment he deserved for being so reckless. He knew he deserved it. He had acted without thinking, had...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm so sorry," his mother whispered through tears. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"If we had chosen to get you a better egg instead of a better school, even if you couldn't cultivate it properly..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We shouldn't have risked your future like this," his father added, his voice trembling. "We shouldn't have believed you would get the same plants as us with such certainty. When I got sick we should have..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren blinked, confused. Were they blaming themselves?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"But I..." he tried to explain, "I was the one who ran away. Who stole the map. Who..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His father hugged him tighter.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We drove you to this. With our expectations, with our..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"No!" Ren pulled back enough to look at them. "You sold everything for me, even the house. Worked so hard to get me a place in the best school, to get me an egg, any egg, and I..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears began falling down his cheeks, mixing with the mud and remaining gray spores.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I just wanted..." his voice broke, "wanted you to be proud..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We always have been," his mother whispered, gently cleaning his dirty face. "Always."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no shouting that night.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">No punishments or severe scolding.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just three people embracing under the light of the twelve moons, crying together while the mushrooms in Ren's hair glowed softly, like fallen stars.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And for the first time since the invocation ceremony, Ren understood something that no knowledge about beasts could have taught him: his parents' love was stronger than any disappointment, deeper than any failure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was unconditional.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The walk back across the prairies was silent, interrupted only by his mother's small, contained sobs as she held his hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if afraid he might disappear if she let go.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">At home, the feast they had prepared to celebrate his invocation was still on the table, now cold.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His mother immediately began reheating it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's not necessary," Ren began, but she was already in the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"You must be hungry," she insisted, wiping away tears while she worked. "You've been outside in the night so long..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">To his own surprise, when the aroma of reheated stew filled the room, his stomach growled fiercely.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He ate as if he hadn't tasted food in days, each bite awakening a deeper hunger. His body seemed to cry out for energy, as if the transformation had awakened a voracious appetite.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm so sorry, son," his father broke the silence, his voice breaking. "If we weren't so poor, if we had worked harder, if we could have gotten you a better egg..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We shouldn't have pressured you so much with our own worry," his mother added, serving another plate of stew that Ren immediately attacked. "You must have felt so..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"If something had happened to you," his father interrupted, "we... couldn't... the sorrow would have..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Don't pressure him with emotional blackmail!" his mother scolded his father. "Can't you see he's suffered enough? Being alone in the forest so long, hiding from frogs in the mud..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">She approached Ren, stroking his dirty hair tenderly. "Would you like a hot bath, darling?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Forgive me," his father covered his face with his hands. "I'm useless. I couldn't even get you a decent beast. But I promise... I'll go to the forest myself. I'll find a miracle medicine, something to replace that spore or to give you a second beast like in the legends. Anything for you, son. Don't misunderstand me, I love you even if you only have that fungus, but for you I..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"No!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The vehemence in Ren's voice surprised everyone, even himself. He stood from the table, fresh tears in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Please, don't say that. Don't apologize. I... I was foolish." His voice trembled but was full of conviction. "This fungus... your gift... is the best gift in the world. I was stupid not to see it before."</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
