His parents were talented cooks; it was what had kept them afloat all these years.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite their low rank.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With their mature Iron-rank plants, the lowest possible, they'd been incredibly lucky to work in the city's most modest kitchens... Sure, the owner was a great person for not discriminating against them, but their skill was undeniable.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the real reason they were accepted there.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The smell of sweet root stew, Ren's favorite, mingled with freshly baked bread.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He stood there, hand on the doorknob, the spore floating pathetically beside him. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through the window, he could see his mother moving through the kitchen with the grace of years of experience, while his father decorated the table with the only three candles they had left.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">They had prepared a celebration feast with the little they had.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he finally pushed the door open, the lump in his throat was so big he could barely breathe.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Ren!" His mother turned slightly before his father.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">They both looked at the small gray spore, and Ren could see the exact moment hope abandoned their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, his mother wiped her hands on her apron and opened her arms. "My little tamer..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tears Ren had held back for hours finally began to fall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm sorry," he whispered as he entered, his voice breaking. "I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Oh, my child," his mother wrapped him in her arms. "It's not your fault. It will never be your fault."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"You spent everything... sold everything... and I..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His father approached, his steps heavy from a long day's exhaustion in the kitchens. He knelt before Ren, placing his large hands on the boy's small shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Son, look at me."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren looked up, his vision blurry with tears.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Remember when I burned an entire batch of bread last year?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren nodded, confused.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"And remember what we did?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We... we cut it into cubes and turned it into croutons."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Exactly," his father smiled. "Sometimes life doesn't give you what you expect. But that doesn't mean you can't make something good with what you have."</span></p><span class="cjhkNWZmZDMwMWYyNzRhZGFiYzhjMmMyNmFkODU5MzA0"><br>Love this novel? Read it on Royal Road to ensure the author gets credit.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"But I... the spore..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"It's part of you now," his mother added. "And we love every part of you."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Hey," his father joined the embrace, his voice hoarse. "You're our son. It doesn't matter if you have a spore or a dragon..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it did matter. Of course it mattered.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dining room was small but filled with love and the aroma of the outskirts' finest cooking...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But try as he might, he couldn't enjoy it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His parents had prepared everything they could in their new situation: sweet root stew, freshly baked bread, they'd even managed to get some wild berries for dessert.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three candles illuminated the table with a warm glow, so different from the spore's gray radiance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Eat a little, darling," his mother served a generous plate. "You've had a long day."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm... I'm not hungry."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Just one bite," his father insisted. "Your mother spent hours cooking."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But not even the aroma of his favorite dish could overcome the bitter taste of disappointment. Ren rose from the table, tears returning to his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm sorry," he whispered before running to his room, the spore following him like a gray shadow of guilt.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Ren!" his mother called. "At least take some bread!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the only response was the sound of a door closing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the dining room, the three candles continued burning, illuminating a table full of food prepared with love and hope. His parents exchanged glances, the weight of worry visible on their tired faces...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The afternoon's attempts bore no fruit either.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'm not hungry," he shouted when his mother knocked on the door with a tray of food.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the darkness of his room, the boy observed the weak flickers of his pathetic companion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">One week.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In one week, he would have to face school, the mockery, the contempt.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">One week to accept that his life would be exactly what everyone expected from someone with the worst possible beast.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A gray life.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the small dining room, the candles illuminated the exhausted faces of two people who had just watched their last hopes turn into gray spores, and the school contract lay on the table.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was mandatory... Once signed, he had to attend the School of Cultivation and Evolution for 8 years.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">There he would learn to strengthen his creature, develop its abilities, become a true tamer. In one of the best schools, if not the best.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or that was the idea, but...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Sixty years," the father murmured, both of them already 60 years old.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their mature Iron-rank plants barely glowed at their wrists and gave them hair composed of leaves and vines, the result of a life of limited cultivation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their hands, weathered by decades working in kitchens, trembled. "We sold everything for this. Everything."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His fingers moved over the document they had signed this morning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one that had cost them over 1 million crystals. The one they'd worked their entire lives for.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In their youth, they hadn't had the resources to buy the secret techniques needed to evolve their beasts beyond the basic state.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A simple 40% increase in vitality and 20% to all attributes was all they got from them, but being mature plants allowed them to pretend they were Bronze 1, barely enough "status" to keep their jobs in the third-rate kitchens on the city's outer line.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luckily, the vitality bonus made them look and feel younger, like a couple in their 40s.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, however, nothing in their life felt like “luck”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We sold everything for this," whispered the mother, tears falling on her worn apron. "Everything so he could have a real chance at a good school. So his plant could grow to Bronze, evolve, give him a better life than ours."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The school was expensive for a reason.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eight years of intensive training, access to cultivation techniques, resources for evolution, connections, everything necessary to transform a common beast into something more.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">They had dreamed of something better for Ren. A rank that would let him walk the main streets without lowering his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a normal plant, Ren would have had the chance to reach Bronze rank 2, improve his vitality to 80% upon maturation and all his base increases to 40%, maybe even get a job in the city's good kitchens learning from his parents.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But with a spore...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"He can't back out now," the mother clutched the contract in her trembling hands, silent tears running down her cheeks. "The payment is made, and the laws are clear, every contract must be fulfilled and every child with a beast must complete their basic education since they passed that law last year."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"If only I hadn't gotten sick, we could have had enough... I was so close to buying the brown egg... But that cursed expensive medicine, I should have di…"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Don't say that! It's not your fault. Ren wouldn't have wanted that," the mother admonished. "Besides, maybe choosing the best and most expensive school was too greedy on our part."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"What have we done..."</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
