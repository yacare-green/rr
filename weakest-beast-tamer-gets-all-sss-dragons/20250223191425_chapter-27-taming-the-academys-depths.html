"At 100 meters, where our regular patrols end, the density is 4 times higher than here on the surface. And the monsters..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if on cue, a distant roar resonated from the depths.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Several students tensed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Beasts are attracted to crystal deposits," Song smiled at their reaction. "The deeper you go, the stronger the mana density... and the more dangerous the visitors it attracts... And remember these aren't normal monsters, they're the abyssals from the hordes the army fights."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Several students tensed again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"But don't worry," Zhao smiled, "we maintain rotating guards down to 150 meters to eliminate any displaced monsters. The mana-hungry beasts in this zone are more pathetic than dangerous really."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"If you want to understand how it's similar to the outer forests... though concentration increases more rapidly down here. At 100 meters, the density barely equals that of the iron ring outside, relatively safe. Though at 200..." he made a significant pause, "well, let's say there's a reason only specialized teams venture that deep."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">They stopped in a small cavern, where crystal veins glowed faintly in the walls.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren examined the veins. Knowledge flowed: these iron crystals were just the beginning. The ones he needed, the bronze ones, formed lower down, where mana was denser.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Song continued, answering another student's question about monsters while demonstrating basic extraction techniques.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The monsters in the depths are in many ways similar to those outside—when they lack mana they become hungry and aggressive. The difference is that here they have nowhere to run. There's only one way out when hunger drives them mad."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another roar, deeper than the previous one, emphasized his words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Ren barely listened. The mushrooms in his hair pulsed ever stronger, as if detecting something in the depths. If the practice caves connected to the ancient ruins...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"However," Song smiled while storing his pick, "not everyone fears them, some particularly... motivated students sometimes form teams and risk going beyond the safe zone. I don't recommend it, but if someone is foolish enough to try..." he looked meaningfully at the Gray Wing students, "at least do it in groups."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren observed Taro working on a nearby vein. His digger beetle, even unevolved, had a natural advantage in tunnels. If he could help him reach his true potential...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He needed those bronze crystals for his own evolution too. But more than that, he needed an ally.</span></p><span class="cjNiNGRlMDVkZDhmZjQwNjZiZTE3YzJiODUwY2NkNGZl"><br>If you come across this story on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen from Royal Road. Please report it.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Song distributed basic mining equipment: small picks, simple detectors, containment bags.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Professor," a student raised her hand, "is it true we can keep what we find?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Absolutely," Song nodded. "Any material you obtain by your own means in these mines counts. But remember: only what you extract yourselves, and only in designated areas."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Though I doubt many of you will need to search so... deep. Besides, after the first year, these caves barely provide useful materials..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His comment was clearly directed at wealthy students, who didn't need to risk themselves for a few extra crystals.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Next week," Song concluded as they returned to the surface, "we'll begin real excavations. Study your notes on crystallization patterns."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren calculated. The ruins must be beyond 200 meters, where guards didn't patrol. It would be dangerous, but with the right knowledge...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He just had to find a way to reach them without being detected.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Professor Song led them back to the building and set them free.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having finished crystal gathering class, Ren and his companions found themselves in a flow of students heading in different directions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"No more classes?" Ren asked, confused.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Liu!" Taro called to their roommate, who was coming down from an upper floor. "Where's everyone going?"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Liu joined them, his night bat barely visible as a shadow on his shoulder. "Ah, right. You're new. The day ends early."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Early?" Min raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The academy has a particular system," Liu began guiding them through the hallways. "After basic classes, students are expected to be... proactive."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He stopped before some enormous doors. The library doors.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The academy library was impressive, shelves rising several stories, sections clearly marked for each beast type.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Classes end early," Liu explained while guiding Ren, Taro and Min through the corridors. "They give students time to familiarize themselves with the library and gathering zones..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"...You can study cultivation techniques specific to your beasts," Liu continued as they entered. "Or you can go to the gathering zones to start collecting materials. The decision is yours."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Most rich family students will go straight to the library," he pointed toward a group already occupying the best tables. "They have resources to buy materials, so they focus on theory."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"And us?" Min asked.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"We," Liu smiled knowingly, "usually divide our time. Some hours in the library, some gathering. We can't afford to ignore any opportunity."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren observed the shelves dedicated to fungi and spores. They were considerably smaller than other sections.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The library is organized by ranks," Liu explained. "Basic techniques below, advanced above. Though," he looked at the mushrooms in Ren's hair, "I suppose in your case..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I'll only need the basic section, yes," Ren completed the phrase, though the mushrooms in his hair pulsed with deeper knowledge.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"For today I recommend an hour here," Liu consulted a wall clock. "Then we can eat and finally check the gathering zones. Though the first days are the worst, more competition for easy veins."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Min was already examining books about water snakes. Taro hesitated between the insect section and the terrestrial beasts one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The academy expects us to be independent," Liu continued while searching for a book for his bat. "Classes are important, but what you do with your free time..." he smiled, "that's what really determines your success here."</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
