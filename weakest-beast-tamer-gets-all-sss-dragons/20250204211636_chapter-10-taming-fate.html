The light blinded him momentarily as he crawled out of the tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn't the outside.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He emerged into a small natural cave, its walls covered in bioluminescent crystals that bathed everything in an ethereal, spectral blue light.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But he could barely appreciate the chamber's beauty, the ancestral fungi continued spreading, consuming his vital energy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Please..." he whispered, his vision blurring. "I don't want to die here..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His spore fought valiantly, its own mushrooms creating barriers against the yellow infection, but it was losing the battle. Ren could feel his consciousness fading, his body growing colder by the second.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">That's when he saw it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the cave's center, bathed in crystal light, grew a plant that seemed like... it reminded him of the one on his father's stories.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The plant..." he mumbled, crawling toward it as the yellow fungi continued their spread. "The one that helped Mother..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His fingers brushed the luminous stem just as darkness began claiming the edges of his vision.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With trembling hands, Ren pulled the glowing plant free. The yellow fungi still expanded across his body, but something in his mind, something deeper than conscious thought, told him this was important.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This plant was...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though he didn't fully understand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His father had found one like it, almost 12 years ago, in another tunnel. The "miracle medicine" that had allowed his mother to conceive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this one was different, where his father's plant had been firm and robust, this one was delicate and ethereal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the "female", his father had found the "male".</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the ancestral fungi consuming his last strength, Ren brought the plant to his lips. The taste was like liquid light, like remembering a dream.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then he felt it, a deep resonance with something already existing in his body, dormant genes inherited from his mother, the echo of the other half of the medicine that had made his existence possible.</span></p><span class="cmQyZGE2MTc1MTQwMTQzZjRhZmI5Y2EyMzFhNWI5MzYw"><br>Unauthorized reproduction: this story has been taken without approval. Report sightings.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two halves of an ancient medicine, separated by years and tunnels, finally reunited in his blood.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The effect was instantaneous.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pure white light emanated from his skin, so intense that the yellow fungi recoiled, withering and falling like ash.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His spore, that supposedly useless creature, began pulsing with a new rhythm, perfectly synchronized with the energy now flowing through his veins.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">To any observer, the spore would have appeared exactly the same, small, apparently weak. But Ren could feel that something had fundamentally changed within.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if it had evolved into a completely new variant, one that no one had ever seen before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">What Ren didn't know, what he couldn't know, was that he had just completed an ancient recipe, a medicine that required three specific ingredients: the male plant, the female plant, and something unique, a host born with the first half of the formula.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He himself was the missing key.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair returned to their usual color, giving the impression that nothing had changed. But in the depths of his being, a dormant power had just awakened.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A power that would change everything.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hunger awakened him first, a ravenous void that made his hands tremble as he pulled the bread with stew from his backpack.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He ate desperately, savoring each bite as if it were the first food he'd ever tasted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair shone with a stronger light than before, illuminating the cave crystals with dancing shadows. Ren noticed, but he'd survived too many horrors that night to worry about such a small change.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As he chewed the last piece of bread, the reality of what he'd done began to hit him. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He'd been seconds from death, multiple times.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the Moon Toads had caught him... if the Excavator had found him... if the Mantis… if the spores…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His parents. What would have become of them if he...?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I should go back," he murmured, guilt weighing heavier than exhaustion. "This was madness. I..."</span></p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Return.</span></em></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice was so soft at first he thought it was his own mind. But there was something different about it, something ancient and wise that resonated deep within his being.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then it began.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if someone had opened a floodgate in his mind, knowledge began to flow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He saw his spore, not as the weak creature everyone despised, but as something with infinite potential. He understood, with crystal clarity, every step necessary for its cultivation:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The exact way to feed it different types of fungi. The precise cultivation to strengthen the bond. The correct sequence of evolutions. The bifurcations in its path to power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it didn't stop there.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Mirror Mantis, he saw how its plates formed, how it channeled light and mana, the weak points in its exoskeleton where cracks always began. Its life cycle…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Night Excavators, the way they built their tunnels, the patterns they followed, how they conserved energy during times of scarcity…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Moon Toads, the mechanism behind their hypnotic eyes, the exact composition of their acid, the mating rituals that determined their hunting patterns…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ecology and biology of the creatures he'd encountered became clear to him now.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if he could see the invisible threads connecting all creatures, understand their most intimate natures, their strengths, their weaknesses, their secrets.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"What... what is this?" he whispered, overwhelmed by the avalanche of information.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair pulsed softly, and for the first time since obtaining his spore, Ren felt he could see the path before him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not just his own.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">All creatures' paths.</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
