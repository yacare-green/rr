In an act of pure instinct, Ren grabbed it. The blade plunged into the tunnel wall, slowing his fall with strength he didn't know he had.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Earth and stones rained around him, striking his face, getting in his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Above, the Mirror Mantis stopped at the hole's edge. Its broken plates created a sickly kaleidoscope of fragmented moons.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The creature tilted its triangular head, calculating, hungry.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"No, no, no..." Ren kicked at the wall, searching for a foothold. The knife was slipping.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The earth gave way and Ren fell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Mantis jumped.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its scythes gleamed in the darkness as it fell, the metal of its broken exoskeleton singing a death song. Ren saw his life flash before his eyes, ten short years that would end in darkness, far from his parents, without even the chance to…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A deafening roar shook the tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The image of the excavator catching him made him drive the knife back in, and in his desperation, he saw a small tunnel beside him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The parallel tunnel was narrow, barely wide enough for Ren to crawl through. Without thinking, Ren pushed himself toward the tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the mantis caught up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, just before it could grab Ren as he entered the tunnel…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wall beneath the mantis opened, revealing the monstrous head of a Night Excavator.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The beast had been hibernating, storing what little mana was available, when the collapse had awakened it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now it was hungry.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Mirror Mantis twisted in the air, its scythes finding excavator flesh instead of its original prey. The Excavator roared in pain, its massive claws emerging from the earth to catch its attacker.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren was paralyzed with terror. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Less than two meters away, two nightmare beasts fought in a deadly dance of metal and earth. The Mantis's broken plates created chaotic flashes in the darkness while the Excavator tried to drag its prey into the depths.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">To his right, almost invisible in the darkness, Ren distinguished an opening. An older tunnel, its walls smoothed by the passage of time.</span></p><span class="cmY2ZmU4NmMyMjRmNDQ2YTA4NDBmMGM0MTRmYjk0Yjk1"><br>The tale has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had no choice. The winner would be decided soon.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He crawled into the tunnel while behind him the battle reached its climax.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Mantis's metallic shriek mixed with the Excavator's roar. There was a horrible crunch, and then...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren crawled away from the edge, his breathing so loud in his ears he feared the winning beast might hear him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">'I'm alive,' he thought, incredulous.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair provided the only light in the tunnel's absolute darkness, their weak glow barely sufficient to see his own trembling hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Please let the Excavator have won, please let the Excavator have won," Ren muttered while crawling as fast as he could.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Night Excavators were territorial and slow, if it won the battle, it would take its time devouring its prey before considering pursuing him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if the Mantis won...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A victorious shriek made his blood freeze. It wasn't the deep roar he'd hoped to hear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"No, no, no..."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair barely illuminated the path when a fork appeared before him. The left tunnel was irregular, clearly the work of some beast. But the right one...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren stopped, panting. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The walls were too smooth, too perfect. Exactly as his father had described in his stories:</span></p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400">"As if someone had melted the stone itself, son. A tunnel of the ancients, from when humans lived here and shaped rock with magic."</span></em></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind him, the wet sound of flesh being torn made him nauseous. The Mantis was feeding. But one meal was all it needed to recover strength and continue hunting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren entered the ancient tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now in a much more spacious place... The mushrooms in his hair revealed marks on the walls, symbols he couldn't understand but that were definitely not natural. This had to be the path his father had found.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tunnel seemed to stretch eternally into darkness.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren had maintained a quick pace for what felt like hours, driven by fear and adrenaline, but now his legs trembled from the effort and his breathing was heavy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He stopped, leaning against the smooth wall of the ancient tunnel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Remembering what his father said about berries helping recover energy and maintaining a clear mind, he ate some of the ones he'd brought.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He thought about lighting a torch with the flint, but he'd forgotten to collect wood and his mushrooms provided enough light...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a clearer mind, he began to analyze his situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to his father's map, he should have found the exit by now. Had he taken a wrong turn? Chosen the wrong tunnel?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair provided light in the absolute darkness, but their glow was barely enough to see a few meters ahead. Though they were better than a torch.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">They had saved him too...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren had been cursing them since he'd invoked them, but now...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"At least you're good for something," he murmured to the spore, still fused with him. "Even if just as a lamp."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He let himself drop to the ground, his legs grateful for the rest. The water from his canteen was lukewarm, but had never tasted better.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">While catching his breath, he studied the mysterious symbols on the walls. Some seemed to respond weakly to his mushrooms' light, as if they recognized something in their faint glow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"I suppose I should thank you for the thing with the toads too," he continued, surprising himself by talking to the world's weakest creature. "Though it was pure luck. You probably didn't even know what you were…"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A distant echo interrupted his words. The unmistakable sound of metal against stone, followed by that blood-freezing hungry hiss.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Mantis had finished feeding.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And this time there would be no more Excavators to distract it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time he would be alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now it was coming for him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"No, no, no..." Ren jumped up when the metallic hiss resonated in the distance, but closer. The mushrooms in his hair now pulsed with a strange yellowish glow, but he barely had time to wonder why.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tunnel stretched before him like a black throat. There were no side exits, no places to hide.</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
