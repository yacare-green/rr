He could hear the soft padding of their feet approaching, the wet sound of their skin secreting acid...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The paralysis was spreading through his limbs when the spore, without warning, fused with his body.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren wanted to scream in frustration, 'Now's not the time to be stubborn, a miserable strength increase won't help me here!'</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The weak glow of the mushrooms in his hair would only serve to attract more predators, making him a more visible target in the night.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Moon Toads were getting closer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">He could hear the rhythmic padding of their feet, the wet sound of their skin secreting acid. The acrid smell already reached his nose, like rotting fruit and hot metal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But something was strange.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The toad in front of him, the one that had paralyzed him, tilted its head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its three eyes blinked in an erratic sequence, breaking the hypnotic pattern. The melodious croaking turned to discordant, confused notes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in Ren's hair pulsed with bioluminescence similar to the toads', creating patterns that mimicked the glow of their internal organs. It was as if his head had become a distorted version of his predators.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The leader toad jumped forward, its three eyes now fixed on the glowing mushrooms. The confusion broke its concentration, and with it, the paralyzing spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren felt control of his body return just as the ground beneath the toad began to give way.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything happened in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The toad, disoriented by the luminescent mushrooms, didn't notice it had landed on the edge of an Excavator tunnel. The earth crumbled beneath its weight with an ominous crunch. Its bright eyes widened in surprise as it fell, its melodious croak transforming into a shriek of panic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A deep roar rose from the tunnel's darkness, followed by the unmistakable sound of jaws snapping shut.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other Moon Toads froze, their bioluminescent patterns becoming erratic with fear. The acid smell intensified, an involuntary defensive reaction.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren didn't stop to think.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His legs, newly freed from paralysis, moved by instinct.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A jump to the right, away from the formerly invisible tunnel edge he could now see thanks to the freshly collapsed earth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"The tunnels!" he gasped as he ran. "They form a pattern!"</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Night Excavators were methodical, territorial. Their tunnels always followed the same design, a main entrance with traps in a semicircle around it. If the toad had fallen into one...</span></p><span class="cmIyYjRjNDRkNTdlZTRhNWJhNDI0NDc1NjE2N2FkYWQ0"><br>The story has been taken without consent; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.<br></span><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another crunch to his left confirmed his theory. Two of the remaining toads, in their rush to chase him, had jumped directly onto another weak section.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The earth opened beneath them like a hungry mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">More roars from the depths. More abruptly interrupted shrieks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last Moon Toad, perhaps wiser than its companions, disappeared into the night with a terrified croak.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">♢♢♢♢</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren stopped, panting, his heart threatening to burst.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mushrooms in his hair still pulsed weakly, but now they seemed more like a reminder of his luck than a curse.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"You," he whispered to his spore, still fused with it, "are still the weakest beast that exists. But... thanks. I guess."</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A distant crunch reminded him this was no time to celebrate. Somewhere beneath his feet, a Night Excavator had just enjoyed an unexpected dinner of Moon Toads.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And he didn't want to be dessert.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dead tree. He had to find the dead tree before…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A deep roar made the earth tremble beneath his feet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just an excavator, he reassured himself, they wouldn't come out...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the noise attracted something else.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A new sound froze Ren's blood, a metallic hiss, like blades dragging against stone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The underground roars quieted, as if trying to go unnoticed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The new sound came from the deep forest, toward the bronze ring, where darkness was densest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren hid behind a tree.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A Mirror Mantis emerged between the trees, its body covered in reflective plates that fragmented the moonlight.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was huge, horse-sized, but something was wrong with it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its plates, which should form a perfect pattern, were cracked and misaligned. Deep scars furrowed its exoskeleton, and one of its main scythes was broken near the tip.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren's heart stopped.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">There shouldn't be a creature like this within 20 kilometers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mirror Mantises were creatures of the deep forest, Bronze-rank beasts that would normally never approach a zone so poor in mana.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their bodies were designed to absorb and reflect the dense magical energy of their territory, using their reflective plates to disorient prey with light and mana illusions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">This one had been expelled from its territory, probably after losing a territorial battle. The wounds had weakened it so much it couldn't even maintain its natural habitat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And a wounded beast, hungry, forced to hunt in poor lands...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was a thousand times more dangerous than any local predator.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Mantis turned its triangular head toward him. Its eye facets, normally a kaleidoscope of iridescent colors, were dull with hunger.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The plates on its body tried to reflect the moonlight, but the pattern was erratic, sickly. Instead of the usual hypnotic illusions, it produced only desperate flashes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">"Don't look at me, don't look at me," Ren silently pleaded, remembering the basic lessons about beasts that every child learned.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mirror Mantises usually hunted by creating illusory duplicates of their prey, confusing them until they stumbled over their own reflections. But this one, in its famished state...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A stray flash created a small reflection beside the tree and illuminated Ren.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The creature moved.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite its wounds, its speed was terrifying. The scythes, even the broken one, cut the air with a deadly whistle. No games, no illusions. Just pure, desperate hunger.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren ran. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dead tree had to be close.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">His father had mentioned that the twisted roots pointed north, that the bark marked by ancient lightning formed an arrow-like pattern...</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind him, the metallic hiss drew closer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Mantis couldn't maintain that speed for long in a zone so poor in mana, but it didn't need to.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It only needed to catch him once.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A scythe plunged into the ground beside him, so close he felt the displaced air cut his cheek. The Mantis's broken plates tinkled like broken bells, its breathing a tortured hiss of hunger and desperation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then Ren saw it, the dead tree, its twisted silhouette cut against the night sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the Mirror Mantis was getting closer, and the sound of its broken plates was like a promise of death.</span></p></div><div class="portlet solid author-note-portlet"><div class="portlet-title"><div class="caption"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"></i><span class="caption-subject bold uppercase">A note from Dagzo</span></div></div><div class="portlet-body author-note"><p style="margin-bottom: 0"><strong>Like it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> ?
